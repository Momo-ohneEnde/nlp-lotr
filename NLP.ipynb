       "\" the world is changed. i feel it in the water. i feel it in the earth. i smell it in the air. much that once was  is lost. for none now live who remember it. it began with the forging of the great rings. three were given to the elves: immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. seven to the dwarf-lords: great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. and nine  nine rings were gifted to the race of men  who, above all else, desire power. for within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race. but they were all of them deceived. for another ring was made. in the land of mordor, in the fires of mount doom  the dark lord sauron forged in secret a master ring  to control all others. and into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice  and his will to dominate all life. one ring to rule them all. one by one  the free lands of middle-earth fell to the power of the ring. but there were some who resisted. a last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of mordor. and on the slopes of mount doom, they fought for the freedom of middle-earth. hold positions! fire the arrows! victory was near. but the power of the ring  could not be undone. it was in this moment  when all hope had faded  that isildur, son of the king, took up his father's sword. sauron, the enemy of the free peoples of middle-earth, was defeated. the ring passed to isildur  who had this one chance to destroy evil forever. but the hearts of men  are easily corrupted. and the ring of power has a will of its own. it betrayed isildur  to his death. and some things that should not have been forgotten  were lost. history became legend  legend became myth. and for two and a half thousand years  the ring passed out of all knowledge. until, when chance came  it ensnared a new bearer. my precious. the ring came to the creature gollum  who took it deep into the tunnels of the misty mountains. and there it consumed him. it came to me. my own. my love. my own. my precious. the ring brought to gollum unnatural long life. for 500 years it poisoned his mind. and in the gloom of gollum's cave, it waited. darkness crept back into the forests of the world. rumor grew of a shadow in the east  whispers of a nameless fear. and the ring of power perceived  its time had now come. it abandoned gollum. but something happened then the ring did not intend. it was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable. what's this? a hobbit. bilbo baggins of the shire. a ring. lost! my precious is lost! for the time will soon come  when hobbits will shape the fortunes of all. the 22nd day of september  in the year 1400  by shire-reckoning. bag end, bagshot row. hobbiton, westfarthing  the shire  middle-earth. the third age of this world. there and back again. a hobbit's tale. by bilbo baggins. now  where to begin? ah, yes  “concerning  hobbits.” hobbits have been living and farming in the four farthings of the shire  for many hundreds of years  quite content to ignore and be ignored  by the world of the big folk. middle-earth being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count  hobbits must seem of little importance  being neither renowned as great warriors  nor counted among the very wise. frodo! someone at the door. in fact, it has been remarked by some  that hobbits' only real passion is for food. a rather unfair observation  as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales  and the smoking of pipe-weed. but where our hearts truly lie  is in peace and quiet  and good, tilled earth. for all hobbits share a love of things that grow. and yes, no doubt to others our ways seem quaint. but today of all days. it is brought home to me  it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life. frodo, the door! sticklebacks. where is that boy? frodo! down from the door where it began and i must follow if i can the road goes ever on and on down from the door where it began now far ahead the road has gone and i must follow if i can you're late. a wizard is never late, frodo baggins. nor is he early. he arrives precisely when he means to. it's wonderful to see you, gandalf! you didn't think i'd miss your uncle bilbo's birthday? so how is the old rascal? i hear it's going to be a party of special magnificence. you know bilbo. he's got the whole piece in an uproar. well, that should please him. half the shire's been invited. and the rest of them are turning up anyway. and so life in the shire goes on  very much as it has this past age  ..full of its own comings and goings, with change coming slowly. if it comes at all. for things are made to endure in the shire  passing from one generation to the next. there's always been a baggins living here under the hill  in bag end. and there always will be. to tell you the truth, bilbo's been a bit odd lateiy. i mean, more than usual. he's taken to locking himself in his study. he spends hours and hours poring over old maps when he thinks i'm not looking. where's it gone? he's up to something. all right, then. keep your secrets. what? but i know you have something to do with it. good gracious me. before you came along, we bagginses were very well thought of. indeed. never had any adventures or did anything unexpected. if you're referring to the incident with the dragon. i was barely involved. all i did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door. whatever you did, you've been officially labeled a disturber of the peace. oh, really? gandalf! gandalf! fireworks, gandalf! gandalf! fireworks, gandalf! gandalf? i'm glad you're back. so am i, dear boy. so am i. whoa, whoa. no, thank you! we don't want any more visitors, well-wishers or distant relations! and what about very old friends? gandalf? bilbo baggins. my dear gandalf! good to see you. 111 years old! who would believe it? you haven't aged a day. come on, come in! welcome, welcome. oh, here we are. tea or maybe something a littie stronger? i've got a few bottles of the old winyard left. 1296. very good year. almost as old as i am. it was laid down by my father. what say we open one, eh? just tea, thank you. i was expecting you sometime last week. not that it matters. you come and go as you please. always have and always will. you caught me a bit unprepared i'm afraid. we've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle  there's some cheese here. no, that won't do. we've got raspberry jam, an apple tart  but not much for afters. oh, no, we're all right. i've just found some sponge cake. i could make you some eggs if you'd li  just tea, thank you. oh, right. you don't mind if i eat, do you? no, not at all. bilbo! bilbo baggins! i'm not at home! it's the sackville-bagginses. i know you're in there! they're after the house. they've never forgiven me for living this long. i've got to get away from these confounded relatives, hanging on the bell all day  never giving me a moment's peace. i want to see mountains again. mountains, gandalf! and then find somewhere quiet where i can finish my book. oh, tea. so you mean to go through with your plan? yes, yes. it's all in hand. all the arrangements are made. oh, thank you. frodo suspects something. of course he does. he's a baggins  not some blockheaded bracegirdle from hardbottle. you will tell him, won't you? yes, yes. he's very fond of you. i know. he'd probably come with me if i asked him. i think in his heart, frodo's still in love with the shire. the woods, the fields. little rivers. i am old, gandalf. i know i don't look it, but i'm beginning to feel it in my heart. i feel thin. sort of stretched  like butter scraped over too much bread. i need a holiday. a very long holiday. and i don't expect i shall return. in fact, i mean not to. old toby. the finest weed in the southfarthing. gandalf, my old friend  this will be a night to remember. hello, hello. fatty bolger. lovely to see you. welcome, welcome. go on, sam. ask rosie for a dance. i think i'll just have another ale. oh, no, you don't. go on! so there i was  at the mercy of three monstrous trolls. and they were all arguing amongst themselves  about how they were going to cook us. whether it be turned on a spit, or whether they should sit on us one by one, squash us into jelly. they spent so much time arguing the whithertos and the whyfors  that the sun's first light crept over the top of the trees  and turned them all to stone! quickly. whoa up they go! no no, the big one — big one mrs. bracegirdle, how nice to see you. welcome, welcome. are all these children yours? good gracious, you have been productive. bilbo? sackville-bagginses! quickly, hide! thank you, my boy. you're a good lad, frodo. i'm very selfish, you know. yes, i am. very selfish. i don't know why i took you in after your mother and father died  but it wasn't out of charity. i think it was because  of all my numerous relations  you were the one baggins that showed real spirit. bilbo, have you been at the gaffer's home brew? no. well, yes, but that's not the point. the point is, frodo  you'll be all right. done! you're supposed to stick it in the ground. it is in the ground. outside! this was your idea. bilbo. bilbo, watch out for the dragon! nonsense. there hasn't been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years. that was good. let's get another one. meriadoc brandybuck and peregrin took. i might've known. speech, bilbo! speech! speech! my dear bagginses and boffins  tooks and brandybucks  grubbs, chubbs  hornblowers  bolgers  bracegirdles  and proudfoots. proudfeet! today is my 111th birthday! happy birthday! but alas, eleventh-one years is far too short a time to live among  such excellent and admirable hobbits. i don't know half of you half as well as i should like  and i like less than half of you half as well as you deserve. i, uh - i have things to do. i've put this off for far too long. i regret to announce this is the end! i'm going now. i bid you all a very fond farewell. goodbye. i suppose you think that was terribly clever. come on, gandalf. did you see their faces? there are many magic rings in this world, bilbo baggins  and none of them should be used lightly. it was just a bit of fun. oh, you're probably right, as usual. you will keep an eye on frodo, won't you? two eyes. as often as i can spare them. i'm leaving everything to him. what about this ring of yours? is that staying too? yes, yes. it's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece. no. wait, it is  here in my pocket. isn't that--? isn't that odd, now? yet, after all, why not? why shouldn't i keep it? i think you should leave the ring behind, bilbo. is that so hard? well, no. and yes. now it comes to it, i don't feel l ike parting with it. it's mine. i found it! it came to me! there's no need to get angry. well, if i'm angry, it's your fault! it's mine. my own. my precious. precious? it's been called that before, but not by you. what business is it of yours what i do with my own things? i think you've had that ring quite long enough. you want it for yourself! bilbo baggins! do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks. i am not trying to rob you. i'm trying to help you. all your long years, we've been friends. trust me as you once did. let it go. you're right, gandalf. the ring must go to frodo. it's late. the road is long. yes, it is time. bilbo. hm? the ring is still in your pocket. ah. yes. i've thought up an ending for my book: “and he lived happily ever after to the end of his days.” and i'm sure you will, my dear friend. goodbye, gandalf. goodbye, dear bilbo. the road goes ever on and on  until our next meeting. it's mine. my own. my precious. riddles in the dark. bilbo! bilbo! my precious. precious. he's gone, hasn't he? he talked for so long about leaving  i didn't think he'd really do it. gandalf? bilbo's ring. he's gone to stay with the elves. he's left you bag end. along with all his possessions. the ring is yours now. put it somewhere out of sight. where are you going? there are some things that i must see to. what things? questions. questions that need answering. you've only just arrived. i don't understand. neither do i. keep it secret. keep it safe. shire! baggins! “the year 3434 of the second age. here follows the account of isildur, high king of gondor  and the finding of the ring of power.” “it has come to me. the one ring. it shall be an heirloom of my kingdom. all those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate  for i will risk no hurt to the ring. it is precious to me  though i buy it with great pain. the markings upon the band begin to fade. the writing, which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared. a secret now that only fire can tell.” shire  baggins. there's no bagginses around here. they're all up in hobbiton. that way. “hey ho to the dock i go to heal my heart and drown my woe rain may fall and wind may blow but there still be  many miles to go sweet is the sound of the pouring rain and the stream that falls from hill to plain better than rain or rippling brook is a mug of beer inside this took!” there's been some strange folk crossing the shire. dwarves and others of a less than savory nature. war is brewing. the mountains are fair teeming with goblins. far-off tales and children's stories, that's all that is. you're beginning to sound like that old bilbo baggins. cracked, he was. young mr. frodo here, he's cracking. and proud of it. cheers, gaffer. aye. cheers. well it's none of our concern what goes on beyond our borders. keep your nose out of trouble, and no trouble'll come to you. good night, lads. good night. good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale. mind who you're sweet-taking. don't worry, sam. rosie knows an idiot when she sees one. does she? good night, sam. good night, mr. frodo. is it secret? is it safe? what are you doing? hold out your hand, frodo. it's quite cool. what can you see? can you see anything? nothing. there's nothing. wait. there are markings. it's some form of elvish. i can't read it. there are few who can. the language is that of mordor, which i will not utter here. mordor! in the common tongue, it says: “one ring to rule them all  one ring to find them  one ring to bring them all  and in the darkness bind them.” this is the one ring  forged by the dark lord sauron in the fires of mount doom. taken by isiidur from the hand of sauron himself. bilbo found it. in gollum's cave. yes. for 60 years, the ring lay quiet in bilbo's keeping  prolonging his life, delaying old age. but no longer, frodo. evil is stirring in mordor. the ring has awoken. it's heard its master's call. but he was destroyed. sauron was destroyed. no, frodo. the spirit of sauron endured. his life force is bound to the ring, and the ring survived. sauron has returned. his orcs have multiplied. his fortress at barad-dã»r is rebuilt in the land of mordor. sauron needs only this ring to cover all the lands in a second darkness. he is seeking it. seeking it — all his thought is bent on it. for the ring yearns above all else  to return to the hand of its master. they are one  the ring and the dark lord. frodo  he must never find it. all right. we put it away. we keep it hidden. we never speak of it again. no one knows it's here, do they? do they, gandalf? there is one other who knew that bilbo had the ring. i looked everywhere for the creature gollum. but the enemy found him first. i don't know how long they tortured him. but amidst the endless screams and inane babble, they discerned two words: shire! baggins! shire. baggins. but that would lead them here! who goes there? take it, gandalf! take it! no, frodo. you must take it! you cannot offer me this ring! i'm giving it to you! don't tempt me, frodo! i dare not take it. not even to keep it safe. understand, frodo  i would use this ring from a desire to do good. but through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine. but it cannot stay in the shire! no no, it can't. what must i do? you must leave. and leave quickly. where? where do i go? get out of the shire. make for the village of bree. bree. what about you? i'll be waiting for you  at the inn of the prancing pony. and the ring will be safe there? i don't know, frodo. i don't have any answers. i must see the head of my order. he is both wise and powerful. trust me, frodo. he'll know what to do. you'll have to leave the name of baggins behind you. that name is not safe outside the shire. travel only by day. and stay off the road. i can cut across country easily enough. my dear frodo. hobbits really are amazing creatures. you can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month. and yet, after a hundred years  they can still surprise you. get down. confound it all, samwise gamgee! have you been eavesdropping? i haven't been dropping no eaves. honest. i was just cutting the grass under the window there if you follow me. a little late for trimming the verge, don't you think? i heard raisedices. what did you hear? speak! nothing important. that is, i heard a good deal about a ring, and a dark lord  and something about the end of the world but  please, mr. gandalf, sir, don't hurt me. don't turn me into anything unnatural. no? perhaps not. i've thought of a better use for you. come along, samwise. keep up. be careful, both of you. the enemy has many spies in his service: birds, beasts. is it safe? never put it on  for the agents of the dark lord will be drawn to its power. always remember, frodo  the ring is trying to get back to its master. it wants to be found. this is it. this is what? if i take one more step  it'll be the farthest away from home i've ever been. come on, sam. remember what bilbo used to say: “it's a dangerous business, frodo.” “going out your door. you step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet  there's no knowing where you might be swept off to.” sam. wood-elves. they're going to the harbor beyond the white towers. to the grey havens. they're leaving middle-earth. never to return. i don't know why  it makes me sad. everywhere i lie there's a dirty great root sticking into my back. just shut your eyes  and imagine you're back in your own bed  with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow. it's not working, mr. frodo. i'm never going to be able to sleep out here. me neither, sam. smoke rises from the mountain of doom. the hour grows late. and gandalf the grey rides to isengard  seeking my counsel. for that is why you have come, is it not? my old friend. saruman. you are sure of this? beyond any doubt. so the ring of power has been found. all these long years, it was in the shire. under my very nose. yet you did not have the wit to see it. your love of the halfling's leaf has clearly slowed your mind. but we still have time. time enough to counter sauron if we act quickly. time? what time do you think we have? sauron has regained much of his former strength. he cannot yet take physical form  but his spirit has lost none of its potency. concealed within his fortress, the lord of mordor sees all. his gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh. you know of what i speak, gandalf. a great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame. the eye of sauron. he is gathering all evil to him. very soon, he'll have summoned an army  great enough for an assault upon middle-earth. you know this? how? i have seen it. a palantir is a dangerous tool, saruman. why? why should we fear to use it? they are not all accounted for, the lost seeing-stones. we do not know who else may be watching. the hour is later than you think. sauron's forces are already moving. the nine have left minas morgul. the nine? they crossed the river isen on midsummer's eve  disguised as riders in black. they've reached the shire? they will find the ring. and kill the one who carries it. frodo! you did not seriously think that a hobbit could contend with the will of sauron? there are none who can. against the power of mordor  there can be no victory. we must join with him, gandalf. we must join with sauron. it would be wise, my friend. tell me  friend  when did saruman the wise abandon reason for madness? i gave you the chance of  aiding me willingly  but you have elected the way of pain! mr. frodo? frodo? frodo! i thought i'd lost you. what are you taking about? it's just something gandalf said. what did he say? “don't you lose him, samwise gamgee.” and i don't mean to. sam, we're still in the shire. what could possibly happen? frodo. merry, it's frodo baggins. hello, frodo. get off him. come on, frodo. what's the meaning of this? you've been into farmer maggot's crop! you get back here! get out of my field! you'll know the devil if i catch up with you! i don't know why he's so upset. it's only a couple of carrots. and some cabbages. and those three bags of potatoes that we lifted last week. and then the mushrooms the week before. yes, pippin. my point is  he's clearly overreacting. run! oh, that was close. i think i've broken something. trust a brandybuck and a took! what? that was just a detour. a short cut. short cut to what? mushrooms! that's mine. that's nice, merry. here's a nice one, sam. i think we should get off the road. get off the road! quick! be quiet! what was that? anything? nothing. what is going on? that black rider was looking for something. or someone. frodo? get down! i have to leave the shire. sam and i must get to bree. right. bucklebury ferry. follow me. run! this way! follow me! run! get the rope, sam! frodo! run, frodo! go! hurry! frodo, come on! come on! faster! jump! how far to the nearest crossing? the brandywine bridge. 20 miles. come on. what do you want? we're heading for the prancing pony. hobbits. four hobbits! what's more, out of the shire by your talk. what business brings you to bree? we wish to stay at the inn. our business is our own. all right young sir, i meant no offense. it's my job to ask questions after nightfall. there's talk of strange folk abroad. can't be too careful. out of the way! watch where you're walking. excuse me. good evening, little masters. what can i do for you? if you're looking for accommodation, we got some nice cozy hobbit-sized rooms available. always proud to cater to little folk, mister ? underhill. my name's underhill. underhill, yeah. we're friends of gandalf the grey. can you tell him we've arrived? gandalf? gandalf. oh, yes  i remember. elderly chap. big grey beard, pointy hat. not seen him for six months. what do we do now? sam  he'll be here. he'll come. get out of my way! what's that? this, my friend, is a pint. it comes in pints? i'm getting one. you got a whole half already! that fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we arrived. excuse me. that man in the corner. who is he? he's one of them rangers. they're dangerous folk they are, wandering the wilds. what his right name is, i've never heard, but 'round here he's known as strider. strider. baggins  baggins  baggins  baggins  baggins  baggins? sure, i know a baggins. he's over there. frodo baggins. he's my second cousin, once removed on his mother's side  and my third cousin, twice removed  pippin! steady on, frodo. you cannot hide. i see you. there is no life  in theid. only  death. you draw far too much attention to yourself, “mr. underhill.” what do you want? a little more caution from you. that is no trinket you carry. i carry nothing. indeed. i can avoid being seen if i wish  but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift. who are you? are you frightened? yes. not nearly frightened enough. i know what hunts you. let him go! or i'll have you, longshanks. you have a stout heart, little hobbit. but that will not save you. you can no longer wait for the wizard, frodo. they're coming. what are they? they were once men. great kings of men. then sauron the deceiver gave to them nine rings of power. blinded by their greed, they took them without question. one by one, falling into darkness. now they are slaves to his will. they are the nazgã»l. ringwraiths. neither living nor dead. at all times they feel  the presence of the ring  drawn to the power of the one. they will never stop hunting you. where are you taking us? into the wild. how can we know this strider is a friend of gandalf? i think a servant of the enemy would look fairer  and feel fouler. he's foul enough. we have no choice but to trust him. but where is he leading us? to rivendell, master gamgee. to the house of elrond. did you hear that? rivendell. we're going to see the elves. gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall. what about breakfast? you've already had it. we've had one, yes. what about second breakfast? don't think he knows about second breakfast, pip. what about elevenses? luncheon? afternoon tea? dinner? supper? he knows about them, doesn't he? i wouldn't count on it. pippin! what do they eat when they can't get hobbit? tinúviel the elven-fair. immortal maiden elven-wise. about him cast her night-dark hair. and arms like silver glimmering. who is she? this woman you sing of. 'tis the lay of luthien. the elf-maiden who gave her love to beren, a mortal. what happened to her? she died. get some sleep, frodo. the power of isengard is at your command  sauron, lord of the earth. build me an army worthy of mordor. what orders from mordor, my lord? what does the eye command? we have work to do. the trees are strong, my lord. their roots go deep. rip them all down. this was the great watchtower of amon sûl. we shall rest here tonight. these are for you. keep them close. i'm going to have a look around. stay here. my tomato's burst. could i have some bacon? want a tomato, sam? what are you doing?! tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon. we saved some for you, mr. frodo. put it out, you fools! put it out! that's nice! ash on my tomatoes! go! back, you devils! theid-in only death frodo! oh, sam. strider! help him, strider. he's been stabbed by a morgul blade. this is beyond my skill to heal. he needs elvish medicine. hurry! we're six days from rivendell! he'll never make it! hold on, frodo. gandalf! look, frodo. it's mr. bilbo's trolls. mr. frodo? he's going cold. is he going to die? he's passing into the shadow world. he'll soon become a wraith like them. they're close. sam, do you know the athelas plant? athelas? kingsfoil. kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed. it may help to slow the poisoning. hurry! what's this, a ranger caught off his guard? frodo. i am arwen — i've come to help you. hear myice, come back to the light. who is she? frodo. she's an elf. he's fading. he's not going to last. we must get him to my father. i've been looking for you for two days. where are you taking him? there are five wraiths behind you. where the other four are, i do not know. stay with the hobbits, i'll send horses for you. i will take him. i am the swifter rider. the road is very dangerous. what are they saying? frodo dies. if i get across the river  the power of my people will protect him. i do not fear them. as you wish. arwen  ride hard. don't look back. ride fast, asfaloth. ride fast! what are you doing?! those wraiths are still out there! ride fast, asfaloth! give up the halfling, she-elf. if you want him, come and claim him. waters of the misty mountains  listen to the great word; flow waters of loudwater against the ringwraiths. waters of the misty mountains  listen to the great word; flow waters of loudwater against the ringwraiths! no. no! frodo, no. frodo, don't give in. not now. what grace is given me  let it pass to him. let him be spared. save him. hear myice come back to the light. where am i? you are in the house of elrond. and it is 10 o'clock in the morning on october 24th, if you want to know. gandalf! yes, i'm here. and you're lucky to be here too. a few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid. but you have some strength in you, my dear hobbit. what happened, gandalf? why didn't you meet us? i am sorry, frodo. i was delayed. a friendship with saruman is not lightly thrown aside. one ill turn deserves another. it is over. embrace the power of the ring  or embrace your own destruction! there is only one lord of the ring. only one who can bend it to his will. and he does not share power. so you have chosen death. gandalf? what is it? nothing, frodo. frodo! sam. bless you, you're awake! sam has hardly left your side. we were that worried about you. weren't we, mr. gandalf? by the skills of lord elrond, you're beginning to mend. welcome to rivendell, frodo baggins. bilbo! hello, frodo, my lad. bilbo. there and back again a hobbit's tale, by bilbo baggins.'' this is wonderful. i meant to go back  wonder at the powers of mirkwood  visit lake-town  see the lonely mountain again. but age, it seems, has finally caught up with me. i miss the shire. i spent all my childhood pretending i was off somewhere else. off with you, on one of your adventures. but my own adventure turned out to be quite different. i'm not like you, bilbo. my dear boy. now, what have i forgotten? packed already? no harm in being prepared. i thought you wanted to see the elves. i do. more than anything. i did. it's just  we did what gandalf wanted, didn't we? we got the ring this far, to rivendell. and i thought  seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be off soon. off home. you are right, sam. we did what we set out to do. the ring will be safe in rivendell. i am ready to go home. his strength returns. that wound will never fully heal. he will carry it the rest of his life. and yet to have come so far still bearing the ring  the hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil. it is a burden he should never have had to bear. we can ask no more of frodo. gandalf, the enemy is moving. sauron's forces are massing in the east. his eye is fixed on rivendell. and saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us. our list of allies grows thin. his treachery runs deeper than you know. by foul craft, saruman has crossed orcs with goblin-men. he's breeding an army in the caverns of isengard. an army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed. saruman is coming for the ring. this evil cannot be concealed by the power of the elves. we do not have the strength to fight both mordor and isengard! gandalf  the ring cannot stay here. this peril belongs to all middle-earth. they must decide now how to end it. the time of the elves is over. my people are leaving these shores. who will you look to when we've gone? the dwarves? they hide in mountains seeking riches. they care not for the troubles of others. it is in men that we must place our hope. men? men are weak. the race of men is failing. the blood of numenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity forgotten. it is because of men the ring survives. i was there, gandalf. i was there 3000 years ago  when isildur took the ring. i was there the day the strength of men failed. isildur, hurry! follow me. i led isildur into the heart of mount doom  where the ring was forged, the one place it could be destroyed. cast it into the fire! destroy it! no. isildur! it should have ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure. isildur kept the ring. the line of kings is broken. there's no strength left in the world of men. they're scattered, divided, leaderless. there is one who could unite them. one who could reclaim the throne of gondor. he turned from that path a long time ago. he has chosen exile. you are no elf. men of the south are welcome here. who are you? i am a friend to gandalf the grey. then we are here on common purpose  friend. the shards of narsil. the blade that cut the ring from sauron's hand. it's still sharp. but no more than a broken heirloom. why do you fear the past? you are isildur's heir, not isildur himseif. you are not bound to his fate. the same blood flows in my veins. the same weakness. your time will come. you will face the same evil. and you will defeat it. till now the shadow not masters, aragorn not over you, not over me. do you remember when we first met? i thought i had strayed into a dream. long years have passed. you did not wear the troubles you carry now. do you remember what i told you? you said you'd bind yourself to me  forsaking the immortal life of your people. and to that i hold. i would rather share one lifetime with you  than face all the ages of this world alone. i choose a mortal life. you cannot give me this. it is mine to give to whom i will  like my heart. strangers from distant lands, friends of old  you've been summoned here to answer the threat of mordor. middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction. none can escape it. you will unite, or you will fall. each race is bound to this fate, this one doom. bring forth the ring, frodo. so it is true. the ring of power  the doom of men  in a dream  i saw the eastern sky grow dark  but in the west a pale light lingered. aice was crying: “your doom is near at hand. isildur's bane is found.” in your blood isildur's bane. boromir! “one ring to rule them all  one ring to find them  one ring to bring them all  and in the darkness bind them.” never before has anyice uttered the words of that tongue here in imladris. i do not ask your pardon, master elrond  for the black speech of mordor  may yet be heard  in every corner of the west! the ring is altogether evil. it is a gift. a gift to the foes of mordor. why not use this ring? long has my father, the steward of gondor  kept the forces of mordor at bay. by the blood of our people  are your lands kept safe. give gondor the weapon of the enemy. let us use it against him. you cannot wield it. none of us can. the one ring answers to sauron alone. it has no other master. and what would a ranger know of this matter? this is no mere ranger. he is aragorn, son of arathorn. you owe him your allegiance. aragorn. this is isildur's heir? and heir to the throne of gondor. sit down, legolas. gondor has no king. gondor needs no king. aragorn is right. we cannot use it. you have only one choice. the ring must be destroyed. then what are we waiting for? in the land of mordor where the shadows lie the ring cannot be destroyed, gimli, son of gloin  by any craft that we here possess. the ring was made in the fires of mount doom. one ring to rule them all  only there can it be unmade. it must be taken deep into mordor  and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came. one ring to find them  one of you  must do this. one does not simply walk into mordor. its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs. there is evil there that does not sleep. the great eye is ever-watchful. it is a barren wasteland  riddled with fire, and ash and dust. the very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. not with 10,000 men could you do this. it is folly. have you heard nothing lord elrond has said? the ring must be destroyed. and i suppose you think you are the one to do it! and if we fail, what then? what happens when sauron takes back what is his? i will be dead before i see the ring in the hands of an elf! never trust an elf! do you not understand? while you bicker amongst yourselves, sauron's power grows! none can escape it! you'll all be destroyed! one ring to rule them all  one ring to find them  one ring to rule them all  one ring to find them  one ring to rule them all  one ring to find them  one ring to rule them all  i will take it. i will take it. i will take the ring to mordor. though  i do not know the way. i will help you bear this burden, frodo baggins  as long as it is yours to bear. if by my life or death i can protect you  i will. you have my sword. and you have my bow. and my ax. you carry the fates of us all, little one. if this is indeed the will of the council  then gondor will see it done. mr. frodo's not going anywhere without me. no indeed it is hardly possible to separate you  even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not. oy. we're coming too! you'll have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us. anyway, you need people of intelligence on this sort of  mission. quest. thing. well, that rules you out, pip. nine companions. so be it. you shall be: the fellowship of the ring. great! where are we going? she wanted to protect her child. she thought in rivendell you would be safe. in her heart, your mother knew you'd be hunted all your life. that you'd never escape your fate. the skill of the elves can reforge the sword of kings  but only you have the power to wield it. i do not want that power. i have never wanted it. you are the last of that bloodline. there is no other. my old sword! sting. here, take it. take it. it's so light. yes, yeah. made by the elves, you know. the blade glows blue when orcs are close. and it's times like that, my lad, when you have to be extra careful. here's a pretty thing. mithril. as light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales. let me see you put it on. come on. my old ring. i should very much like  to hold it again, one last time. i'm sorry i brought this upon you, my boy. i'm sorry that you must carry this burden. i'm sorry for everything. the ring-bearer is setting out on the quest of mount doom. on you who travel with him, no oath  nor bond is laid to go further than you will. farewell. hold to your purpose. may the blessings of elves and men  and all free folk go with you. the fellowship awaits the ring-bearer. mordor, gandalf, is it left or right? left. we must hold to this course, west of the misty mountains, for 40 days. if our luck holds, the gap of rohan will still be open to us. from there, our road turns east to mordor. two, one, five. good! very good. move your feet. you look good, pippin. thanks. faster! if anyone was to ask for my opinion, which i note they're not  i'd say we were taking the long way 'round. gandalf. we could pass through the mines of moria. my cousin balin would give us a royal welcome. no gimli, i would not take the road through moria unless i had no other choice. sorry! get him! for the shire! hold him. hold him down, merry! gentlemen, that's enough. you've got my arm! you've got my arm! what is that? nothing. it's just a wisp of cloud. it's moving fast. against the wind. crebain from dunland! hide! merry! take cover! spies of saruman. the passage south is being watched. we must take the pass of caradhras. frodo! boromir. it is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt  over so small a thing. such a little thing. boromir! give the ring to frodo. as you wish. i care not. so, gandalf, you try to lead them over caradhras. and if that fails, where then will you go? if the mountain defeats you  will you risk a more dangerous road? wake up cruel redhorn! there is a fellice on the air. may your horn be bloodstained! it's saruman! he's trying to bring down the mountain! gandalf, we must turn back! no! sleep caradhras, be still, lie still, hold your wrath! wake up cruel redhorn! may your bloodstained horn  fall upon the enemy-heads! we must get off the mountain! make for the gap of rohan, and take the west road to my city! the gap of rohan takes us too close to isengard! we cannot pass over a mountain. let us go under it. let us go through the mines of moria. moria. you fear to go into those mines. the dwarves delved too greedily and too deep. you know what they awoke in the darkness of khazad-dûm: shadow and flame. let the ring-bearer decide. we cannot stay here! this will be the death of the hobbits. frodo? we will go through the mines. so be it. frodo, come and help an old man. how is your shoulder? better than it was. and the ring? you feel its power growing, don't you? i've felt it too. you must be careful now. evil will be drawn to you from outside the fellowship. and, i fear, from within. who then do i trust? you must trust yourself. trust your own strengths. what do you mean? there are many powers in this world  for good or for evil. some are greater than i am. and against some i have not yet been tested. the walls  of moria. dwarf doors are invisible when closed. yes, gimli, their own masters cannot find them if their secrets are forgotten. why doesn't that surprise me? well, let's see. “moon-star” it mirrors only starlight and moonlight. it reads; “the doors of durin, lord of moria. speak, friend, and enter.” what do you suppose that means? oh it's quite simple. if you are a friend, you speak the password and the doors will open. gate of the elves, open now for me! doorway of the dwarf-folk  listen to the word of my tongue. nothing's happening. i once knew every spell in all the tongues of elves  men and orcs. what are you going to do, then? knock your head against these doors, peregrin took! and if that does not shatter them  and i am allowed a little peace from foolish questions  i will try to find the opening words. gate of elves  listen to my word  threshold of dwarves! mines are no place for a pony. even one so brave as bill. bye-bye, bill. doorway of the dwarf-folk  go on, bill. go on. don't worry, sam, he knows the way home. do not disturb the water. oh, it's useless. it's a riddle. “speak 'friend' and enter.” what's the elvish word for “friend”? mellon. soon, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the dwarves. roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone! this, my friend, is the home of my cousin balin. and they call it a mine. a mine! this is no mine. it's a tomb. no  no! goblins. we make for the gap of rohan. we should never have come here. now, get out of here. get out! frodo! help! strider! help! get off him! aragorn! frodo! into the mines! legolas! into the cave! run! we now have but one choice. we must face the long dark of moria. be on your guard. there are older and fouler things than orcs  in the deep places of the world. quietly now. it's a four-day journey to the other side. let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed. the wealth of moria was not in gold  or jewels  but mithril. bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that thorin gave him. oh, that was a kingly gift. yes. i never told him  but its worth was greater than the value of the shire. pippin. i have no memory of this place. are we lost? no. i think we are. gandalf's thinking. merry? what? i'm hungry. there's something down there. it's gollum. gollum? he's been following us for three days. he escaped the dungeons of barad-dûr? escaped  or was set loose. now the ring has brought him here. he will never be rid of his need for it. he hates and loves the ring, as he hates and loves himseif. smeagol's life is a sad story. yes, smeagol he was once called. before the ring found him. before it drove him mad. it's a pity bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance. pity? it is pity that stayed bilbo's hand. many that live deserve death. some that die deserve life. can you give it to them, frodo? do not be too eager to deal out death and judgment. even the very wise cannot see all ends. my heart tells me that gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill  before this is over. the pity of bilbo may rule the fate of many. i wish the ring had never come to me. i wish none of this had happened. so do all who live to see such times. but that is not for them to decide. all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. there are other forces at work in this world, frodo, besides the will of evil. bilbo was meant to find the ring. in which case, you also were meant to have it. and that is an encouraging thought. it's that way. he's remembered. no. but the air doesn't smell so foul down here. if in doubt, meriadoc, always follow your nose. let me risk a little more light. behold  the great realm and dwarf-city of dwarrowdelf. now there's an eye opener, and no mistake. gimli! no! oh, no. no. “here lies balin  son of fundin  lord of moria.” he is dead, then. it's as i feared. we must move on. we cannot linger. “they have taken the bridge and the second hall. we have barred the gates  but cannot hold them for long. the ground shakes. drums  drums in the deep. we cannot get out. a shadow moves in the dark. we cannot get out. they are coming.” fool of a took! throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity. frodo! orcs. get back! stay close to gandalf! they have a cave-troll. let them come! there is one dwarf yet in moria who still draws breath. i think i'm getting the hang of this. frodo! aragorn! aragorn! frodo! frodo! oh, no. he's alive. i'm all right. i'm not hurt. you should be dead. that spear would have skewered a wild boar. i think there's more to this hobbit than meets the eye. mithril. you are full of surprises, master baggins. to the bridge of khazad-dûm! this way! what is this new devilry? a balrog. a demon of the ancient world. this foe is beyond any of you. run! quickly! gandalf. lead them on, aragorn. the bridge is near. do as i say! swords are no more use here. gandalf! merry! pippin! sam! nobody tosses a dwarf. not the beard! steady. hold on! hang on! lean forward! steady. come on! now! over the bridge! fly! you cannot pass! gandalf! i am a servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of anor. the dark fire will not avail you, flame of udûn! go back to the shadow. you — shall not — pass! no! no! gandalf! fly, you fools! no! aragorn! legolas, get them up. give them a moment, for pity's sake! by nightfall, these hills will be swarming with orcs. we must reach the woods of lothlórien. come, boromir. legolas. gimli, get them up. on your feet, sam. frodo? frodo! stay close, young hobbits! they say that a great sorceress lives in these woods. an elf-witch  of terrible power. all who look upon her  fall under her spell. frodo! and are never seen again. your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom. you bring great evil here, ring-bearer. mr. frodo? well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily. i have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox. the dwarf breathes so loud, we could have shot him in the dark. well met, legolas son of thranduil. our fellowship stands in your debt,… haldir of lórien. oh, aragorn of the dúnedain  you are known to us. haldir. so much for the legendary courtesy of the elves! speak words we can all understand! we have not had dealings with the dwarves since the dark days. and you know what this dwarf says to that? i spit upon your grave! that was not so courteous. you bring great evil with you. you can go no further. we need your protection. the road is very dangerous. merin le telim. i wish we may come with you. please, understand. we need your support! aragorn! i wish we may come with you. the road is very dangerous. gandalf's death was not in vain. nor would he have you give up hope. you carry a heavy burden, frodo. don't carry the weight of the dead. you will follow me. caras galadhon. the heart of elvendom on earth. realm of the lord celeborn and of galadriel, lady of light. the enemy knows you have entered here. what hope you had in secrecy is now gone. eight there are here, yet nine there were set out from rivendell. tell me, where is gandalf? for i much desire to speak with him. i can no longer see him from afar. gandalf the grey did not pass the borders of this land. he has fallen into shadow. he was taken by both shadow and flame. a balrog of morgoth. for we went needlessly into the net of moria. needless were none of the deeds of gandalf in life. we do not yet know his full purpose. do not let the great emptiness of khazad-dûm fill your heart  gimli, son of gloin. for the world has grown full of peril  and in all lands  love is now mingled with grief. what now becomes of this fellowship? without gandalf, hope is lost. the quest stands upon the edge of a knife. stray but a little and it will fail  to the ruin of all. yet hope remains while the company is true. do not let your hearts be troubled. go now and rest  for you are weary with sorrow and much toil. tonight, you will sleep  welcome, frodo of the shire  one who has seen the eye! a lament for gandalf. what do they say about him? i have not the heart to tell you. for me, the grief is still too near. i bet they don't mention his fireworks. there should be a verse about them. the finest rockets ever seen they burst in stars of blue and green or after thunder, silver showers came falling like a rain of flowers oh, that doesn't do them justice by a long road. take some rest. these borders are well-protected. i will find no rest here. i heard herice inside my head. she spoke of my father and the fall of gondor. she said to me; “even now there is hope left.” but i cannot see it. it is long since we had any hope. my father is a noble man. but his rule is failing  and our people lose faith. he looks to me to make things right, and i would do it. i would see the glory of gondor restored. have you ever seen it, aragorn? the white tower of ecthelion. glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver. its banners caught high in the morning breeze. have you ever been called home  by the clear ringing of silver trumpets? i have seen the white city  long ago. one day, our paths will lead us there. and the tower guard shall take up the call: “the lords of gondor have returned.” will you look into the mirror? what will i see? even the wisest cannot tell. for the mirror  shows many things. things that were  things that are  and some things  that have not yet come to pass. i know what it is you saw. for it is also in my mind. it is what will come to pass if you should fail. the fellowship is breaking. it is already begun. he will try to take the ring. you know of whom i speak. one by one, it will destroy them all. if you ask it of me  i will give you the one ring. you offer it to me freely. i do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this. in place of a dark lord, you would have a queen  not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn! treacherous as the sea! stronger than the foundations of the earth! all shall love me  and despair. i pass the test. i will diminish  and go into the west  and remain galadriel. i cannot do this alone. you are a ring-bearer, frodo. to bear a ring of power  is to be alone. this is nenya, the ring of adamant. and i am its keeper. this task was appointed to you. and if you do not find a way  no one will. then i know what i must do. it's just  i'm afraid to do it. even the smallest person can change the course of the future. do you know how the orcs first came into being? they were elves once. taken by the dark powers  tortured and mutilated. a ruined and terrible form of life. and now  perfected. my fighting uruk-hai  whom do you serve? saruman! hunt them down. do not stop until, they are found. you do not know pain. you do not know fear. you will taste man-flesh! one of the halflings carries something of great value. bring them to me alive and unspoiled. kill the others. never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people. may these cloaks help shield you from unfriendly eyes. lembas. elvish waybread. one small bite is enough to fill the stomach of a grown man. how many did you eat? four. every league you travel south, the danger will increase. mordor orcs now hold the eastern shore of the anduin. nor will you find safety on the western bank. strange creatures bearing the mark of the white hand have been seen on our borders. seldom do orcs journey in the open under the sun, yet these have done so. you are being followed. by river you have the chance of outrunning the enemy to the falls of rauros. my gift for you, legolas, is a bow of the galadhrim. worthy of the skill of our woodland kin. these are the daggers of the noldorin. they have already seen service in war. do not fear, young peregrin took. you will find your courage. and for you, samwise gamgee  elven rope made of hithlain. thank you, my lady. have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers? and what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves? nothing. except to look upon the lady of the galadhrim one last time  for she is more fair than all the jewels beneath the earth. actually  there was one thing. no, no, i couidn't. it's quite impossible. stupid to ask. i have nothing greater to give  than the gift you already bear. for her love  the gift of life of arwen will dwindle. i wish that she endures, even if we separate  beyond the limits of this world. i wish that she sails to valinor. that choice is yet before her. you have your own choice to make, aragorn. to rise above the height of all your fathers since the days of elendil  or to fall into darkness with all that is left of your kin. farewell. there is much you have yet to do. we shall not meet again, elessar. farewell, frodo baggins. i give you the light of earendil  our most beloved star. may it be a light for you in dark places  when all other lights go out. i have taken my worst wound at this parting  having looked my last upon that which is fairest. henceforth i will call nothing fair unless it be her gift to me. what was her gift? i asked her for one hair from her golden head. she gave me three. gollum. he has tracked us since moria. i had hoped we would lose him on the river. but he's too clever a waterman. and if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts  it will make the crossing even more dangerous. have some food, mr. frodo. no, sam. you haven't eaten anything all day. you're not sleeping, neither. don't think i haven't noticed. mr. frodo i'm all right. but you're not. i'm here to help you. i promised gandalf that i would. you can't help me, sam. not this time. get some sleep. minas tirith is the safer road. you know that. from there we can regroup. strike out for mordor from a place of strength. there is no strength in gondor that can avail us. you were quick enough to trust the elves. have you so little faith in your own people? yes, there is weakness. there is frailty. but there is courage also, and honor to be found in men. but you will not see that. you are afraid! all your life, you have hidden in the shadows. scared of who you are, of what you are. i will not lead the ring within a hundred leagues of your city. frodo. the argonath. long have i desired to look upon the kings of old. my kin. we cross the lake at nightfall. hide the boats and continue on foot. we approach mordor from the north. oh, yes? just a simple matter of finding our way through emyn muil  an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks. and after that, it gets even better. festering, stinking marshland as far as the eye can see. that is our road. i suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, master dwarf. recover my  we should leave now. no. orcs patrol the eastern shore. we must wait for cover of darkness. it is not the eastern shore that worries me. a shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind. something draws near. i can feel it. recover strength? pay no heed to that, young hobbit. where's frodo? none of us should wander alone. you, least of all. so much depends on you. frodo? i know why you seek solitude. you suffer. i see it day by day. you sure you do not suffer needlessly? there are other ways, frodo. other paths that we might take. i know what you would say. it would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart. warning against what? we're all afraid, frodo. but to let that fear drive us, to destroy what hope we have  don't you see that is madness? there is no other way. i ask only for the strength to defend my people! if you would but lend me the ring. no. why do you recoil? i am no thief. you are not yourself. what chance do you think you have? they will find you. they will take the ring. and you will beg for death before the end! you fool! it is not yours, save by unhappy chance! it could have been mine. it should be mine! give it to me! give it to me! no! give it to me! no. i see your mind. you will take the ring to sauron! you will betray us! you'll go to your death, and the death of us all! curse you! curse you and all the halflings! frodo? frodo. what have i done? please, frodo. frodo, i'm sorry! here inid, only death. frodo? it has taken boromir. where is the ring? stay away! frodo! i swore to protect you. can you protect me from yourself? would you destroy it? aragorn. aragorn. elessar. i would have gone with you to the end. into the very fires of mordor. i know. look after the others. especially sam. he will not understand. go, frodo! run. run! mr. frodo! find the halfling! find the halfling! elendil! aragorn, go! frodo! hide here. quick! come on! what's he doing? he's leaving. no! pippin! run, frodo. go! hey! hey, you! over here! hey! over here! this way! it's working! i know it's working! run! the horn of gondor. boromir. run! no. they took the little ones. hold still. frodo. where is frodo? i let frodo go. then you did what i could not. i tried to take the ring from him. the ring is beyond our reach now. forgive me. i did not see it. i have failed you all. no, boromir. you fought bravely. you have kept your honor. leave it. it is over. the world of men will fall and all will come to darkness  and my city to ruin. i do not know what strength is in my blood  but i swear to you, i will not let the white city fall  nor our people fail. our people. our people. i would have followed you, my brother. my captain. my king. be at peace  son of gondor. they will look for his coming from the white tower. but he will not return. frodo! i wish the ring had never come to me. i wish none of this had happened. so do all who live to see such times  but that is not for them to decide. all you have to decide  is what to do with the time that is given to you. frodo, no! frodo! mr. frodo! no, sam. go back, sam! i'm going to mordor alone. of course you are. and i'm coming with you! you can't swim! sam! sam! i made a promise, mr. frodo. a promise: “don't you leave him, samwise gamgee.” and i don't mean to. i don't mean to. oh sam. come on. hurry! frodo and sam have reached the eastern shore. you mean not to follow them. frodo's fate is no longer in our hands. then it has all been in vain. the fellowship has failed. not if we hold true to each other. we will not abandon merry and pippin to torment and death. not while we have strength left. leave all that can be spared behind. we travel light. let us hunt some orc. yes! mordor. i hope the others find a safer road. strider will look after them. i don't suppose we'll ever see them again. we may yet, mr. frodo. we may. sam  i'm glad you're with me.\""

nothing. just a dream. can you see the bottom? no! don\\'t look down, sam! just keep going! catch it! grab it, mr. frodo! mr. frodo! i think i\\'ve found the bottom. bogs and rope, and goodness knows what. it\\'s not natural. none of it. what\\'s in this? nothing. just a bit of seasoning. i thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something. roast chicken?! you never know. sam. my dear sam. it\\'s very special, that. it\\'s the best salt in all the shire. it is special. it\\'s a little bit of home. we can\\'t leave this here for someone to follow us down. who\\'s gonna follow us down here, mr. frodo? it\\'s a shame, really. lady galadriel gave me that. real elvish rope. well, there\\'s nothing for it. it\\'s one of my knots. won\\'t come free in a hurry. real elvish rope. mordor. the one place in middle-earth we don\\'t want to see any closer. and it\\'s the one place we\\'re trying to get to. it\\'s just where we can\\'t get. let\\'s face it, mr. frodo, we\\'re lost. i don\\'t think gandalf meant for us to come this way. he didn\\'t mean for a lot of things to happen, sam  but they did. mr. frodo? it\\'s the ring, isn\\'t it? it\\'s getting heavier. what food have we got left? well, let me see. oh, yes. lovely. lembas bread. and look! more lembas bread. i don\\'t usually hold with foreign food  but this elvish stuff, it\\'s not bad. nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, sam? those rain clouds might. this looks strangely familiar. it\\'s because we\\'ve been here before. we\\'re going in circles. what is that horrid stink? i warrant there\\'s a nasty bog nearby. can you smell it? yes. i can smell it. we\\'re not alone. the thieves. the thieves. the filthy little thieves. where is it? where is it? they stole it from us. my precious. curse them, we hates them! it\\'s ours, it is, and we wants it! this is sting. you\\'ve seen it before  haven\\'t you, gollum? release him or i\\'ll cut your throat. it burns! it burns us! it freezes! nasty elves twisted it. take it off us! quiet, you! it\\'s hopeless. every orc in mordor\\'s going to hear this racket. let\\'s just tie him up and leave him. no! that would kill us! kill us! it\\'s no more than you deserve! maybe he does deserve to die. but now that i see him, i do pity him. we be nice to them if they be nice to us. take it off us. we swears to do what you wants. we swears. there\\'s no promise you can make that i can trust. we swears  to serve the master of the precious. we will swear on  on the precious. gollum. gollum. the ring is treacherous. it will hold you to your word. yes  on the precious. on the precious. i don\\'t believe you! get down! i said, down! sam! he\\'s trying to trick us. if we let him go, he\\'ll throttle us in our sleep. you know the way to mordor? yes. you\\'ve been there before? yes. you will lead us to the black gate. to the gate, to the gate! to the gate, the master says. yes! no! we won\\'t go back. not there. not to him. they can\\'t make us. gollum! gollum! but we swore to serve the master of the precious. no. ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits. and orcses, thousands of orcses. and always the great eye watching, watching. hey! come back now! come back! there! what did i tell you? he\\'s run off, the old villain. so much for his promises. this way, hobbits. follow me! merry! merry! you\\'re late. our master grows impatient. he wants the shire-rats now. i don\\'t take orders from orc-maggots. saruman will have his prize. we will deliver them. merry! merry? wake up. my friend is sick. he needs water. please! sick, is he? give him some medicine, boys! stop it! can\\'t take his draught! leave him alone! why? you want some? then keep your mouth shut. merry. hello, pip. you\\'re hurt. i\\'m fine. it was just an act. an act? see? i fooled you too. don\\'t worry about me, pip. what is it? what do you smell? man-flesh. they\\'ve picked up our trail. aragorn. let\\'s move! their pace has quickened. they must have caught our scent. hurry! come on, gimli! three days and nights pursuit. no food. no rest. and no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell. not idly do the leaves of lorien fall. they may yet be alive. less than a day ahead of us. come. come, gimli! we\\'re gaining on them! i\\'m wasted on cross-country. we dwarves are natural sprinters. very dangerous over short distances. rohan. home of the horse-lords. there\\'s something strange at work here. some evil gives speed to these creatures. sets its will against us. legolas! what do your elf-eyes see? the uruks turn northeast. they\\'re taking the hobbits to isengard. saruman. the world is changing. who now has the strength to stand against the armies of isengard  and mordor? to stand against the might of sauron and saruman  and the union of the two towers? together, my lord sauron  we shall rule this middle-earth. the old world will burn in the fires of industry. the forests will fall. a new order will rise. we will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear  and the iron fists of the orc. i want them armed and ready to march within two weeks! but, my lord, there are too many! they cannot all be armed in time, we don\\'t have the means. build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day. we don\\'t have enough fuel to feed the fires. the forest of fangorn lies on our doorstep. burn it. yes. we will fight for you. swear it. we will die for saruman. the horse-men took your lands. they drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks. murderers! take back the lands they stole from you. burn every village! we have only to remove those who oppose us. it will begin in rohan. too long have these peasants stood against you. but no more. eothain! eothain! you take your sister. you\\'ll go faster with just two. papa says eothain must not ride garulf. he is too big for him. listen to me. you must ride to edoras and raise the alarm. do you understand me? yes, mama. i don\\'t want to leave. i don\\'t want to go, mama. freda, i will find you there. quickly! go, child. rohan, my lord  is ready to fall. theodred. find the king\\'s son! mordor will pay for this. these orcs are not from mordor. my lord eomer, over here! he\\'s alive. theodred. your son is badly wounded, my lord. he was ambushed by orcs. if we don\\'t defend our country, saruman will take it by force. that is a lie. saruman the white has ever been our friend and ally. grima. grima. grima. orcs are roaming freely across our lands. unchecked. unchallenged. killing at will. orcs bearing the white hand of saruman. why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind? can you not see? your uncle is wearied by your malcontent  your warmongering. warmongering? how long is it since saruman bought you? what was the promised price, grima? when all the men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure? too long have you watched my sister. too long have you haunted her steps. you see much, eomer, son of eomund. too much. you are banished forthwith from the kingdom of rohan  and all its domains under pain of death. you have no authority here. your orders mean nothing. this order does not come from me. it comes from the king. he signed it this morning. keep breathing. that\\'s the key. breathe. they\\'ve run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them. we\\'re not going no further  until we\\'ve had a breather. get a fire going! merry! merry! i think we might have made a mistake leaving the shire, pippin. what\\'s making that noise? it\\'s the trees. what? you remember the old forest, on the borders of buckland? folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall  and come alive. alive? trees that could whisper  talk to each other  even move. i\\'m starving. we ain\\'t had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days. yeah! why can\\'t we have some meats?! what about them? they\\'re fresh. they are not for eating. what about their legs? they don\\'t need those. they look tasty. get back, scum! the prisoners go to saruman. alive and unspoiled. alive? why alive? do they give good sport? they have something. an elvish weapon. the master wants it for the war. they think we have the ring. as soon as they find out we don\\'t, we\\'re dead. just a mouthful  a bit of the flank. looks like meat\\'s back on the menu, boys. pippin. let\\'s go. go on. call for help. squeal. no one\\'s gonna save you now. pippin! a red sun rises. blood has been spilled this night. riders of rohan  what news from the mark? what business does an elf, a man and a dwarf have in the riddermark? speak quickly! give me your name, horse-master, and i shall give you mine. i would cut off your head, dwarf  if it stood but a little higher from the ground. you would die before your stroke fell. i am aragorn, son of arathorn. this is gimli, son of gloin, and legolas of the woodland realm. we are friends of rohan and of theoden, your king. theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe. not even his own kin. saruman has poisoned the mind of the king  and claimed lordship over these lands. my company are those loyal to rohan. and for that, we are banished. the white wizard is cunning. he walks here and there, they say  as an old man hooded and cloaked. and everywhere, his spies slip past our nets. we are no spies. we track a party of uruk-hai westward across the plain. they have taken two of our friends captive. the uruks are destroyed. we slaughtered them during the night. but there were two hobbits. did you see two hobbits with them? they would be small. only children to your eyes. we left none alive. we piled the carcasses and burned them. dead? i am sorry. hasufel! arod! may these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters. farewell. look for your friends. but do not trust to hope. it has forsaken these lands. we ride north! it\\'s one of their wee belts. may they find peace after death. we failed them. a hobbit lay here. and the other. they crawled. their hands were bound. their bonds were cut. they ran over here. they were followed. the belt! run! tracks lead away from the battle  into fangorn forest. fangorn? what madness drove them in there? did we lose him? i think we lost him. i\\'m going to rip out your filthy little innards! come here! trees. climb a tree. he\\'s gone. merry! let\\'s put a maggot hole in your belly! run, merry! little orcs. bru-ra-hroom. it\\'s talking, merry. the tree is talking. tree? i am no tree! i am an ent. a tree-herder. a shepherd of the forest. don\\'t talk to it, merry. don\\'t encourage it! treebeard, some call me. and whose side are you on? side? i am on nobody\\'s side  because nobody\\'s on my side, little orc. nobody cares for the woods anymore. we\\'re not orcs! we\\'re hobbits! hobbits? never heard of a hobbit before. sounds like orc mischief to me! they come with fire. they come with axes. gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning! destroyers and usurpers! curse them! no! you don\\'t understand. we\\'re hobbits! halflings! shire-folk! maybe you are  and maybe you aren\\'t. the white wizard will know. the white wizard? saruman. see? see? we\\'ve led you out. hurry, hobbitses. hurry! very lucky we find you. nice hobbit. it\\'s a bog. he\\'s led us into a swamp. a swamp, yes, yes. come, master. we will take you on safe paths through the mist. come, hobbits! come! we go quickly. i found it. i did. the way through the marshes. orcs don\\'t use it. orcs don\\'t know it. they go round for miles and miles. come quickly. soft and quick as shadows we must be. i hate this place. it\\'s too quiet. there\\'s been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days. no, no birdses to eat. no crunchable birdses. we are famished! yes! famished we are, precious! here. what does it eats? is it tasty? it tries to chokes us! we can\\'t eats hobbit food! we must starve! well, starve, then. and good riddance! oh, cruel hobbit. it does not care if we be hungry. it does not care if we should die. not like master. master cares. master knows. yes. precious. once it takes hold of us  it never lets go. don\\'t touch me! there are dead things! dead faces in the water. all dead. all rotten. elves and men and orcses. a great battle long ago. dead marshes. yes. yes, that is their name. this way. don\\'t follow the lights. careful now! or hobbits go down to join the dead ones  and light little candles of their own. frodo! gollum? don\\'t follow the lights. gollum! mr. frodo! are you all right? so bright. so beautiful. our precious. what did you say? master should be resting. master needs to keep up his strength. who are you? mustn\\'t ask us. not its business. gollum. gollum. gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk. cold be heart and hand and bone cold be travelers far from home he said your life was a sad story. they do not see what lies ahead when sun has failed and moon is dead you were not so very different from a hobbit once. were you? smeagol. what did you call me? that was your name once, wasn\\'t it? a long time ago. my name. my name. smeagol. black riders! hide! hide! come on, frodo. come on! quick! they will see us! they will see us! i thought they were dead. dead? no, you cannot kill them. no. wraiths! wraiths on wings! they are calling for it. they are calling for the precious. mr. frodo! it\\'s all right. i\\'m here. hurry, hobbits. the black gate is very close. orc blood. these are strange tracks. the air is so close in here. this forest is old. very old. full of memory  and anger. the trees are speaking to each other. gimli! lower your ax. they have feelings, my friend. the elves began it. waking up the trees, teaching them to speak. talking trees. what do trees have to talk about? except the consistency of squirrel droppings. aragorn, something is out there! what do you see? the white wizard approaches. do not let him speak. he will put a spell on us. we must be quick. you are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits. where are they? they passed this way the day before yesterday. they met someone they did not expect. does that comfort you? who are you? show yourself! it cannot be. forgive me. i mistook you for saruman. i am saruman. or rather, saruman as he should have been. you fell. through fire  and water. from the lowest dungeon to the highest peak  i fought with the balrog of morgoth. until at last i threw down my enemy  and smote his ruin upon the mountainside. darkness took me  and i strayed out of thought and time. stars wheeled overhead  and every day was as long as a life age of the earth. but it was not the end. i felt life in me again. i\\'ve been sent back  until my task is done. gandalf. gandalf? yes. that was what they used to call me. gandalf the grey. that was my name. gandalf. i am gandalf the white. and i come back to you now  at the turn of the tide. one stage of your journey is over. another begins. we must travel to edoras with all speed. edoras? that is no short distance! we hear of trouble in rohan. it goes ill with the king. yes, and it will not be easily cured. then we have run all this way for nothing? are we to leave those poor hobbits here  in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested ? i mean, charming  quite charming forest. it was more than mere chance that brought merry and pippin to fangorn. a great power has been sleeping here for many long years. the coming of merry and pippin will be like the falling of small stones  that starts an avalanche in the mountains. in one thing you have not changed, dear friend. you still speak in riddles. a thing is about to happen that has not happened since the elder days. the ents are going to wake up  and find that they are strong. strong?! oh, that\\'s good. so stop your fretting, master dwarf. merry and pippin are quite safe. in fact, they are far safer than you are about to be. this new gandalf\\'s more grumpy than the old one. that is one of the mearas  unless my eyes are cheated by some spell. shadowfax. he is the lord of all horses  and has been my friend through many dangers. o rowan mine i saw you shine upon a summer\\'s day upon your head how golden-red the crown you bore aloft such a beautiful verse. is it much further? bru-ra-hroom. don\\'t be hasty. you might call it far, perhaps. my home lies deep in the forest  near the roots of the mountain. i told gandalf i would keep you safe. and safe is where i\\'ll keep you. i believe you will enjoy this next one too. it\\'s one of my own compositions. right. beneath the roof of sleeping leaves and the dreams of trees unfold when woodland halls are green and cool and the wind is in the west come back to me come back to me and say my land is best sleep, little shirelings. heed no nightly noise. sleep till morning light. i have business in the forest. there are many to call. many that must come. the shadow lies on fangorn. the withering of all woods is drawing near. the veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape. sauron will suffer no rival. from the summit of barad-dur, his eye watches ceaselessly. but he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear. doubt ever gnaws at him. the rumor has reached him. the heir of numenor still lives. sauron fears you, aragorn. he fears what you may become. and so he\\'ll strike hard and fast at the world of men. he will use his puppet saruman to destroy rohan. war is coming. rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge  for rohan is weak and ready to fall. the king\\'s mind is enslaved, it\\'s an old device of saruman\\'s. his hold over king theoden is now very strong. sauron and saruman are tightening the noose. but for all their cunning  we have one advantage. the ring remains hidden. and that we should seek to destroy it  has not yet entered their darkest dreams. and so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards mordor  in the hands of a hobbit. each day brings it closer to the fires of mount doom. we must trust now in frodo. everything depends upon speed  and the secrecy of his quest. do not regret your decision to leave him. frodo must finish this task alone. he\\'s not alone. sam went with him. did he? did he, indeed? good. yes, very good. the black gate of mordor. oh, save us. my old gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now. master says to show him the way into mordor. so good smeagol does, master says so. i did. that\\'s it, then. we can\\'t get past that. look! the gate. it\\'s opening! i can see a way down. sam, no! master! i do not ask you to come with me, sam. i know, mr. frodo. i doubt even these elvish cloaks will hide us in there. now! no! no! no, master! they catch you! they catch you! don\\'t take it to him. he wants the precious. always he is looking for it. and the precious is wanting to go back to him. but we mustn\\'t let him have it. no! there\\'s another way. more secret. a dark way. why haven\\'t you spoken of this before? because master did not ask. he\\'s up to something. are you saying there\\'s another way into mordor? yes. there\\'s a path  and some stairs. and then  a tunnel. he\\'s led us this far, sam. mr. frodo, no. he\\'s been true to his word. no. lead the way, smeagol. good smeagol always helps. hello? treebeard? where has he gone? i had the loveliest dream last night. there was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed. and we smoked all of it. and then  you were sick. i\\'d give anything for a whiff of old toby. did you hear that? there it is again. something\\'s not right here. not right at all. you just said something treeish. no, i didn\\'t. i was just stretching. you\\'re taller. who? you! than what? than me! i\\'ve always been taller than you. pippin, everyone knows i\\'m the tall one. you\\'re the short one. please, merry. you\\'re what? three-foot-six? at the most? whereas me, i\\'m pushing 3\\'7\". 3\\'8\"! three-foot-eight. you did something. merry, don\\'t! don\\'t drink it! merry! treebeard said, treebeard said you shouldn\\'t have any. i want some! he said it could well be dangerous! give me it back. merry! what\\'s happening?! it\\'s got my leg! merry! help! away with you. you should not be waking. eat earth. dig deep. drink water. go to sleep. away with you. come, the forest is waking up. it isn\\'t safe. the trees have grown wild and dangerous. anger festers in their hearts. black are their thoughts. strong is their hate. they will harm you if they can. there are too few of us now. too few of us ents left to manage them. why are there so few of you when you have lived so long? are there ent children? bru-ra-hroom. there have been no entings for a terrible long count of years. why is that? we lost the entwives. oh, i\\'m sorry. how did they die? die? no. we lost them. and now we cannot find them. i don\\'t suppose you\\'ve seen entwives in the shire? can\\'t say that i have. you, pip? what do they look like? i don\\'t remember now. edoras and the golden hall of meduseld. there dwells theoden, king of rohan  whose mind is overthrown. saruman\\'s hold over king theoden is now very strong. my lord, your son  he is dead. my lord? uncle? will you not go to him? will you do nothing? be careful what you say. do not look for welcome here. oh, he he must have died sometime in the night. what a tragedy for the king  to lose his only son and heir. i understand. his passing is hard to accept. especially now that your brother has deserted you. leave me alone, snake! oh, but you are alone. who knows what you\\'ve spoken to the darkness  in the bitter watches of the night  when all your life seems to shrink. the walls of your bower closing in about you. a hutch to trammel some wild thing in. so fair. so cold. like a morning of pale spring  still clinging to winter\\'s chill. your words are poison. you\\'ll find more cheer in a graveyard. i cannot allow you before theoden king so armed, gandalf greyhame. by order of grima wormtongue. your staff. you would not part an old man from his walking stick. my lord, gandalf the grey is coming. he\\'s a herald of woe. the courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late  theoden king. he\\'s not welcome. why should i welcome you  gandalf stormcrow? a just question, my liege. late is the hour  in which this conjurer chooses to appear. lathspell i name him. ill news is an ill guest. be silent. keep your forked tongue behind your teeth. i have not passed through fire and death  to bandy crooked words with a witless worm. his staff. i told you to take the wizard\\'s staff. theoden  son of thengel  too long have you sat in the shadows. i would stay still if i were you. hearken to me! i release you  from the spell. you have no power here  gandalf the grey. i will draw you, saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound. wait. if i go, theoden dies. you did not kill me  you will not kill him. rohan is mine. be gone. i know your face. eowyn. eowyn. gandalf? breathe the free air again, my friend. dark have been my dreams of late. your fingers would remember their old strength better  if they grasped your sword. i\\'ve only  ever served you, my lord. your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast! send me not from your sight. no, my lord! no, my lord. let him go. enough blood has been spilt on his account. get out of my way! hail, theoden king! where is theodred? where is my son? an evil death has set forth the noble warrior  a song shall sing sorrowing minstrels. in meduseld  that he is no more  for his necessary rest. and that he is the dearest kinsman  killing took him  simbelmyn. ever has it grown on the tombs of my forbearers. now it shall cover the grave of my son. alas that these evil days should be mine. the young perish and the old linger. that i should live  to see the last days of my house. theodred\\'s death was not of your making. no parent should have to bury their child. he was strong in life. his spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers. be thou well. go thou, théodred, go thou. they had no warning. they were unarmed. now the wild men are moving through the westfold, burning as they go. rick, cot and tree. where is mama? this is but a taste of the terror that saruman will unleash. all the more potent for he is driven now by fear of sauron. ride out and meet him head on. draw him away from your women and children. you must fight. you have 2000 good men riding north as we speak. eomer is loyal to you. his men will return and fight for their king. they will be 300 leagues from here by now. eomer cannot help us. i know what it is you want of me  but i will not bring further death to my people. i will not risk open war. open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not. when last i looked  theoden, not aragorn, was king of rohan. then what is the king\\'s decision? by order of the king  the city must empty. we make for the refuge of helm\\'s deep. do not burden yourself with treasures. take only what provisions you need. helm\\'s deep. they flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight. who will defend them if not their king? he\\'s only doing what he thinks is best for his people. helm\\'s deep has saved them in the past. there is no way out of that ravine. theoden is walking into a trap. he thinks he\\'s leading them to safety. what they will get is a massacre. theoden has a strong will, but i fear for him. i fear for the survival of rohan. he will need you before the end, aragorn. the people of rohan will need you. the defenses have to hold. they will hold. the grey pilgrim. that\\'s what they used to call me. three hundred lives of men i\\'ve walked this earth, and now i have no time. with luck, my search will not be in vain. look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. at dawn, look to the east. go. that horse is half mad, my lord. there\\'s nothing you can do. leave him. fast  quiet now. fast  quiet  quiet  quiet  quiet  a battle is stirring, you heard. what is your name? what is your name? his name is brego. he was my cousin\\'s horse. brego. your name is kingly. what troubles you, brego? what did you see? i have heard of the magic of elves  but i did not look for it in a ranger from the north. you speak as one of their own. i was raised in rivendell  for a time. turn this fellow free. he\\'s seen enough of war. gandalf the white. gandalf the fool! does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety? there were three who followed the wizard. an elf, a dwarf and a man. you stink of horse. the man  was he from gondor? no, from the north. one of the dunedain rangers, i thought he was. his cloth was poor. and yet he bore a strange ring. two serpents with emerald eyes. one devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers. the ring of barahir. so gandalf greyhame thinks he has found isildur\\'s heir. the lost king of gondor. he is a fool. the line was broken years ago. it matters not. the world of men shall fall. it will begin at edoras. i am ready, gamling. bring my horse. this is not a defeat. we will return. we will return. you have some skill with a blade. women of this country learned long ago: those without swords can still die upon them. i fear neither death nor pain. what do you fear, my lady? a cage. to stay behind bars until use and old age accept them. and all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire. you\\'re a daughter of kings  a shield maiden of rohan. i do not think that would be your fate. theoden will not stay at edoras. it\\'s vulnerable. he knows this. he will expect an attack on the city. they will flee to helm\\'s deep  the great fortress of rohan. it is a dangerous road to take through the mountains. they will be slow. they will have women and children with them. send out your warg-riders. hey, stinker, don\\'t go getting too far ahead. why do you do that? what? call him names. run him down all the time. because. because that\\'s what he is, mr. frodo. there\\'s naught left in him but lies and deceit. it\\'s the ring he wants. it\\'s all he cares about. you have no idea what it did to him  what it\\'s still doing to him. i want to help him, sam. why? because i have to believe he can come back. you can\\'t save him, mr. frodo. what do you know about it? nothing! i\\'m sorry, sam. i don\\'t know why i said that. i do. it\\'s the ring. you can\\'t take your eyes off it. i\\'ve seen you. you\\'re not eating. you barely sleep. it\\'s taken hold of you, mr. frodo. you have to fight it. i know what i have to do, sam. the ring was entrusted to me. it\\'s my task. mine! my own! can\\'t you hear yourself? don\\'t you know who you sound like? we wants it. we needs it. must have the precious. they stole it from us. sneaky little hobbitses. wicked. tricksy. false. no. not master. yes, precious. false. they will cheat you, hurt you, lie! master\\'s my friend. you don\\'t have any friends. nobody likes you. not listening. i\\'m not listening. you\\'re a liar and a thief. no. murderer. go away. go away? i hate you. i hate you. where would you be without me? gollum. gollum. i saved us. it was me. we survived because of me. not anymore. what did you say? master looks after us now. we don\\'t need you. what? leave now  and never come back. no. leave now and never come back. leave now and never come back! we we told him to go away. and away he goes, precious. gone! gone! gone! smeagol is free! look. look. see what smeagol finds? they are young. they are tender. they are nice. yes, they are. eat them. eat them! you\\'ll make him sick, you will  behaving like that. there\\'s only one way to eat a brace of coneys. what\\'s it doing? stupid, fat hobbit. it ruins it. what\\'s to ruin? there\\'s hardly any meat on \\'em. waht we need\\'s a few good taters. what\\'s taters, precious? what\\'s taters? eh? po-ta-toes. boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew. lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish. even you couldn\\'t say no to that. oh, yes, we could. spoil a nice fish. give it to us raw  and wriggling. you keep nasty chips. you\\'re hopeless. mr. frodo? who are they? wicked men. servants of sauron. they are called to mordor. the dark one is gathering all armies to him. it won\\'t be long now. he will soon be ready. ready to do what? to make his war. the last war that will cover all the world in shadow. we\\'ve got to get moving. come on, sam. mr. frodo. look. it\\'s an oliphaunt. no one at home will believe this. smeagol? we\\'ve lingered here too long. come on, sam. wait! we\\'re innocent travelers! there are no travelers in this land. only servants of the dark tower. we are bound to an errand of secrecy. those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us. the enemy? his sense of duty was no less than yours, i deem. you wonder what his name is  where he came from. and if he was really evil at heart. what lies or threats led him on this long march from home. if he would not rather have stayed there  in peace. war will make corpses of us all. bind their hands. it\\'s true, you don\\'t see many dwarf women. and in fact, they are so alike inice and appearance  that they\\'re often mistaken for dwarf men. it\\'s the beards. this, in turn, has given rise to the belief  that there are no dwarf women  and that dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground  which is, of course, ridiculous. it\\'s all right. it\\'s all right. nobody panic. that was deliberate. it was deliberate. i haven\\'t seen my niece smile for a long time. she was a girl when they brought her father back dead. cut down by orcs. she watched her mother succumb to grief. then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear. doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father. gimli. no, i couldn\\'t i really couldn\\'t. i made some stew. it isn\\'t much, but it\\'s hot. thank you. it\\'s good. really? my uncle told me a strange thing. he said that you rode to war with thengel, my grandfather. but he must be mistaken. king theoden has a good memory. he was only a small child at the time. then you must be at least 60. seventy? but you cannot be 80! eighty-seven. you are one of the dunedain. a descendant of numenor, blessed with long life. it was said that your race had passed into legend. there are few of us left. the northern kingdom was destroyed long ago. i\\'m sorry. please, eat. the light of the evenstar does not wax and wane. it is mine to give to whom i will. like my heart. go to sleep. i am asleep. this is a dream. then it is a good dream. sleep. you told me once  this day would come. this is not the end it is the beginning. you must go with frodo. that is your path. my path is hidden from me. it is already laid before your feet. you cannot falter now. arwen  if you trust nothing else  trust this  trust us. where is she? the woman who gave you that jewel. our time here is ending. arwen\\'s time is ending. let her go. let her take the ship into the west. let her bear away her love for you to the undying lands. there it will be ever green. but never more than memory. i will not leave my daughter here to die. she stays because she still has hope. she stays for you. she belongs with her people. sharepirate.com subs is this how you leave? did you think you could slip away at first light unseen? i shall not return. you underestimate your skill in battle. you will return. i do not speak of death in battle. what do you speak of? the way is open to you  the way to another life  away from war grief, despair. why are you saying this? i am mortal. you are elf-kind. it was a dream, arwen. nothing more. i don\\'t believe you. this belongs to you. it was a gift. keep it. my lord? she is sailing to the undying lands with all that is left of her kin. what is it? hama? i\\'m not sure. wargs! a scout! what is it? what do you see? warg! we\\'re under attack! get them out of here! all riders to the head of the column. come on. get me up here. i\\'m a rider. come on! you must lead the people to helm\\'s deep, and make haste. i can fight. no! you must do this, for me. follow me! forward. i mean, charge forward. make for the lower ground! that\\'s it! go on! stay together! bring your pretty face to my ax. that one counts as mine! stinking creature. aragorn! aragorn? tell me what happened and i will ease your passing. he\\'s  dead. he took a little tumble off the cliff. you lie. get the wounded on horses. the wolves of isengard will return. leave the dead. come. at last! helm\\'s deep. there it is, helm\\'s deep. we\\'re safe! we\\'re safe, my lady. thank you. mama! eothain! freda! where is the rest? this is all we could save, my lady. take it to the caves. make way for the king. make way for theoden. make way for the king. so few. so few of you have returned. our people are safe. we have paid for it with many lives. my lady. lord aragorn  where is he? he fell. draw all our forces behind the wall. bar the gate. and set a watch on the surround. what of those who cannot fight, my lord? the women and children? get them into the caves. saruman\\'s arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here. helm\\'s deep has one weakness. its outer wall is solid rock  but for a small culvert at its base  which is little more than a drain. how? how can fire undo stone? what kind of device could bring down the wall? if the wall is breached, helm\\'s deep will fall. even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning  thousands, to storm the keep. tens of thousands. but, my lord, there is no such force. a new power is rising. its victory is at hand. this night  the land will be stained with the blood of rohan! march to helm\\'s deep! leave none alive! to war! there will be no dawn for men. look. there\\'s smoke to the south. there is always smoke rising  from isengard these days. isengard? there was a time  when saruman would walk in my woods. but now he has a mind of metal  and wheels. he no longer cares for growing things. what is it? it\\'s saruman\\'s army. the war has started. may the grace of the valar protect you. brego. arwen. it is time. the ships are leaving for valinor. go now before it is too late. i have made my choice. he is not coming back. why do you linger here when there is no hope? there is still hope. if aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted. if sauron is defeated and aragorn made king  and all that you hope for comes true  you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality. whether by the sword or the slow decay of time  aragorn will die. and there will be no comfort for you  no comfort to ease the pain of his passing. he will come to death  an image of the splendor of the kings of men  in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world. but you, my daughter  you will linger on in darkness and in doubt  as nightfall in winter that comes without a star. here you will dwell  bound to your grief under the fading trees  until all the world is changed  and the long years of your life are utterly spent. arwen. there is nothing for you here  only death. and i, do i not have your love? you have my love, father. the world is changed. i feel it in the water. i feel it in the earth, and i smell it in the air. the power of the enemy is growing. sauron will use his puppet, saruman  to destroy the people of rohan. isengard has been unleashed. the eye of sauron now turns to gondor  the last free kingdom of men. his war on this country will come swiftly. he senses the ring is close. the strength of the ring-bearer is failing. in his heart, frodo begins to understand  the quest will claim his life. you know this. you have foreseen it. it is the risk we all took. in the gathering dark, the will of the ring grows strong. it works hard now to find its way back into the hands of men. men, who are so easily seduced by its power. the young captain of gondor has but to extend his hand  take the ring for his own, and the world will fall. it is close now. so close to achieving its goal. for sauron will have dominion over all life on this earth  even unto to the ending of the world. the time of the elves  is over. do we leave middle-earth to its fate? do we let them stand alone? what news? our scouts report saruman has attacked rohan. theoden\\'s people have fled to helm\\'s deep. but we must look to our own borders. faramir, orcs are on the move. sauron is marshaling an army. easterlings and southrons are passing through the black gate. how many? some thousands. more come every day. who\\'s covering the river to the north? we pulled 500 men at osgiliath. if their city is attacked, we won\\'t hold it. saruman attacks from isengard. sauron from mordor. the fight will come to men on both fronts. gondor is weak. sauron will strike us soon. and he will strike hard. he knows now we do not have the strength to repel him. my men tell me that you are orc spies. spies? now wait just a minute. well, if you\\'re not spies, then who are you? speak. we are hobbits of the shire. frodo baggins is my name, and this is samwise gamgee. your bodyguard? his gardener. and where is your skulking friend? that gangrel creature. he had an ill-favored look. there was no other. we set out from rivendell with seven companions. one we lost in moria  two were my kin  a dwarf there was also. and an elf and two men. aragorn, son of arathorn, and boromir of gondor. you\\'re a friend of boromir? yes. for my part. it will grieve you then to learn that he is dead. dead? how? when? as one of his companions, i\\'d hoped you would tell me. if something has happened to boromir, we would have you tell us. his horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past. it was cloven in two. but more than this, i know it in my heart. he was my brother. boromir! boromir! this city was once the jewel of our kingdom. a place of light and beauty and music. and so it shall be once more! let the armies of mordor know this: never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands. this city of osgiliath has been reclaimed for gondor! for gondor! for gondor! for gondor! for gondor! good speech. nice and short. leaves more time for drinking! break out the ale! these men are thirsty! remember today, little brother. today, life is good. what? he\\'s here. one moment of peace, can he not give us that? where is he? where is gondor\\'s finest? where is my first-born? father! they say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handed. they exaggerate. the victory belongs to faramir also. but for faramir, this city would still be standing. were you not entrusted to protect it? i would have done, but our numbers were too few. oh, too few. you let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim. always you cast a poor reflection on me. that is not my intent. you give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will. he loves you, father. do not trouble me with faramir  i know his uses, and they are few. we have more urgent things to speak of. elrond of rivendell has called a meeting. he will not say why, but i have guessed its purpose. it is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found. the one ring. isildur\\'s bane. and it has fallen into the hands of the elves. everyone will try to claim it: men, dwarves, wizards. we cannot let that happen. this thing must come to gondor. gondor. it\\'s dangerous, i know. ever the ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser men. but you, you are strong. and our need is great. it is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying. sauron is biding his time. he\\'s massing fresh armies. he will return. and when he does, we will be powerless to stop him. you must go. bring me back this mighty gift. no. my place is here with my people. not in rivendell. would you deny your own father? if there is need to go to rivendell  send me in his stead. you? oh, i see. a chance for faramir, captain of gondor, to show his quality. i think not. i trust this mission only to your brother. the one who will not fail me. remember today, little brother. captain faramir! we found the third one. you must come with me. now. down there. to enter the forbidden pool bears the penalty of death. they wait for my command. shall i shoot? the rock and pool is nice and cool so juicy sweet our only wish to catch a fish so juicy sweet wait. this creature is bound to me. and i to him. he is our guide. please  let me go down to him. smeagol. master is here. come, smeagol. trust master. come. we must go now? smeagol, you must trust master. follow me. come on. come. come, smeagol. nice smeagol. that\\'s it. come on. don\\'t hurt him! smeagol, don\\'t struggle. smeagol, listen to me. master! that\\'s enough. where are you leading them? answer me. smeagol. why does it cry, smeagol? cruel men hurts us. master tricksed us. of course he did. i told you he was tricksy. i told you he was false. master is our friend. our friend. master betrayed us. no. not its business. leave us alone! filthy little hobbitses! they stole it from us! no. no. what did they steal? my precious! we have to get out of here. you go. go, now. you can do it. use the ring, mr. frodo. just this once. put it on. disappear. i can\\'t. you were right, sam. you tried to tell me but  i\\'m sorry. the ring\\'s taking me, sam. if i put it on  he\\'ll find me. he\\'ll see. mr. frodo  so this is the answer to all the riddles. here in the wild i have you  two halflings  and a host of men at my call. the ring of power within my grasp. a chance for faramir, captain of gondor  to show his quality. no! stop it! leave him alone. don\\'t you understand? he\\'s got to destroy it! that\\'s where we\\'re going, into mordor. to the mountain of fire! osgiliath is under attack. they call for reinforcements. please. it\\'s such a burden. will you not help him? captain? prepare to leave. the ring will go to gondor. well done, brego, my friend. he\\'s alive! where is he? where is he? get out of the way! i\\'m gonna kill him! you are the luckiest, the canniest  and the most reckless man i ever knew. bless you, laddie. gimli, where is the king? you\\'re late. you look terrible. thank you. a great host, you say? all isengard is emptied. how many? ten thousand strong at least. ten thousand? it is an army bred for a single purpose: to destroy the world of men. they will be here by nightfall. let them come! i want every man and strong lad able to bear arms  to be ready for battle by nightfall. we will cover the causeway and the gate from above. no army has ever breached the deeping wall  or set foot inside the hornburg! this is no rabble of mindless orcs. these are uruk-hai. their armor is thick and their shields broad. i have fought many wars, master dwarf. i know how to defend my own keep. they will break upon this fortress like water on rock. saruman\\'s hordes will pillage and burn. we\\'ve seen it before. crops can be resown  homes rebuilt. within these walls  we will outlast them. they do not come to destroy rohan\\'s crops or villages. they come to destroy its people  down to the last child. what would you have me do? look at my men. their courage hangs by a thread. if this is to be our end, then i would have them make such an end  as to be worthy of remembrance. send out riders, my lord. you must call for aid. and who will come? elves? dwarves? we are not so lucky in our friends as you. the old alliances are dead. gondor will answer. gondor?! where was gondor when the westfold fell?! where was gondor when our enemies closed in around us?! where was gon ? no, my lord aragorn  we are alone. get the women and children into the caves. we need more time to lay provisions  there is no time. war is upon us. secure the gate. we ents have not troubled  about the wars of men and wizards  for a very long time. but now, something is about to happen  that has not happened  for an age. entmoot. what\\'s that? \\'tis a gathering. a gathering of what? beech. oak. chestnut. ash. good. good. good. many have come. now we must decide if the ents  will go to war. move back! move to the caves! come on, people! quickly, now! we\\'ll place the reserves along the wall. they can support the archers from above the gate. aragorn, you must rest. you\\'re no use to us half alive. my lord! aragorn! i\\'m to be sent with the women into the caves. that is an honorable charge. to mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return. what renown is there in that? my lady, a time may come for valor without renown. who then will your people look to in the last defense? let me stand at your side. it is not in my power to command it. you do not command the others to stay! they fight beside you because they would not be parted from you. because they love you. i\\'m sorry. farmers, farriers, stable boys. these are no soldiers. most have seen too many winters. or too few. look at them. they\\'re frightened. i can see it in their eyes. and they should be three hundred… against ten thousand they have more hope of defending themselves here than at edoras aragorn, they cannot win this fight. they are all going to die! then i shall die as one of them! let him go, lad. let him be. every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory. my lord? who am i, gamling? you are our king, sire. and do you trust your king? your men, my lord  will follow you to whatever end. to whatever end. where is the horse and the rider? where is the horn that was blowing? they have passed like rain on the mountains. like wind in the meadow. the days have gone down in the west  behind the hills  into shadow. how did it come to this? it\\'s been going for hours. they must have decided something by now. decided? no. we only just finished saying  good morning. but it\\'s nighttime already. you can\\'t take forever. don\\'t be hasty. we\\'re running out of time! move! move to the outer wall. give me your sword. what is your name? haleth, son of hama, my lord. the men are saying that we will not live out the night. they say that it is hopeless. this is a good sword. haleth, son of hama  there is always hope. we have trusted you this far. you have not led us astray. forgive me. i was wrong to despair. there is nothing to forgive, legolas. we had time, i\\'d get this adjusted. it\\'s a little tight across the chest. that is no orc horn. send for the king. open the gate! open up the gate! how is this possible? i bring word from elrond of rivendell. an alliance once existed between elves and men. long ago we fought and died together. we come to honor that allegiance. well met, haldir! you are most welcome. we are proud to fight alongside men once more. you could have picked a better spot. well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let\\'s hope it lasts the night. your friends are with you, aragorn. let\\'s hope they last the night. o, children of eru  show them no mercy… for you shall receive none! what\\'s happening out there? shall i describe it to you? or would you like me to find you a box? hold! so it begins. prepare to fire! their armour is weak… at the throat  and beneath the arm. release arrows! did they hit anything? give them alley. fire! fire! send them to me! come on! ladders! good! swords! swords! legolas! two already! i\\'m on 17! i\\'ll have no pointy-ear outscoring me! nineteen! merry. we have just agreed. yes? i have told your names to the entmoot  and we have agreed  you are not orcs. well, that\\'s good news. and what about saruman? have you come to a decision about him? now, don\\'t be hasty, master meriadoc. hasty? our friends are out there. they need our help. they cannot fight this war on their own. war? yes. it affects us all. tree, root and twig. but you must understand, young hobbit  it takes a long time  to say anything in old entish  and we never say anything  unless it is worth taking  a long time to say. seventeen! eighteen! nineteen! twenty! twenty-one! causeway! towards the causeway! is this it? is this is all you can conjure, saruman? bring him down, legolas! kill him! kill him! brace the gate! hold them! stand firm! aragorn! gimli! hurl the arrows! charge! the ents cannot hold back this storm. we must weather such things as we have always done. how can that be your decision?! this is not our war. but you\\'re part of this world! aren\\'t you?! you must help. please. you must do something. you are young and brave, master merry. but your part in this tale is over. go back to your home. maybe treebeard\\'s right. we don\\'t belong here, merry. it\\'s too big for us. what can we do in the end? we\\'ve got the shire. maybe we should go home. the fires of isengard will spread  and the woods of tuckborough and buckland will burn. and  and all that was once green and good in this world will be gone. there won\\'t be a shire, pippin. aragorn! fall back to the keep! get your men out of there! to the keep! pull back! haldir! pull back! what are you doing? what are you stopping for? pull back! haldir! brace the gate! hold them! to the gate. draw your swords! make way! we cannot hold much longer! hold them!  how long do you need? as long as you can give me. gimli! timbers! brace the gate! come on. we can take \\'em. it\\'s a long way. toss me. what? i cannot jump the distance! you\\'ll have to toss me! don\\'t tell the elf. not a word. shore up the door! make way! follow me to the barricade. watch our backs! throw another one over here! higher! hold fast the gate! gimli! aragorn! get out of there! aragorn! pull everybody back. pull them back. fall back! fall back! they have broken through! the castle is breached. retreat! fall back! retreat! hurry! inside. get them inside! into the keep! i will leave you at the western borders of the forest. you can make your way north to your homeland from there. wait! stop! stop! turn around. turn around. take us south. south? but that will lead you past isengard. yes. exactly. if we go south, we can slip past saruman unnoticed. the closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm. it\\'s the last thing he\\'ll expect. that doesn\\'t make sense to me. but then  you are very small. perhaps you\\'re right. south it is, then. hold on, little shirelings. i always like going south. somehow it feels like going downhill. are you mad? we\\'ll be caught. no, we won\\'t. not this time. look! osgiliath burns! mordor has come. the ring will not save gondor. it has only the power to destroy. please  let me go. hurry. faramir! you must let me go! and those little family of field mice  that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully. they\\'re always trying to get somewhere where they  many of these trees were my friends. creatures i had known from nut and acorn. i\\'m sorry, treebeard. they hadices of their own. saruman. a wizard should know better! there is no curse in elvish  entish or the tongues of men  for this treachery. look! the trees! they\\'re moving! where are they going? they have business with the orcs. my business is with isengard tonight  with rock and stone. yes. come, my friends. the ents are going to war. it is likely  that we go to our doom. last march  of the ents. faramir! orcs have taken the eastern shore. their numbers are too great. by nightfall we will be overrun. mr. frodo? it\\'s calling to him, sam. his eye is almost on me. hold on, mr. frodo. you\\'ll be all right. take them to my father. tell him faramir sends a mighty gift. a weapon that will change our fortunes in this war. do you want to know what happened to boromir? you want to know why your brother died? he tried to take the ring from frodo after swearing an oath to protect him! he tried to kill him! the ring drove your brother mad! watch out! mr. frodo? they\\'re here. they\\'ve come. nazgul! stay here. keep out of sight. take cover! the fortress is taken. it is over. you said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it. they still defend it. they have died defending it. they\\'re breaking in! they\\'re past the door! is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves? is there no other way? there is one passage. it leads into the mountains. but they will not get far. the uruk-hai are too many. send word for the women and children to make for the mountain pass. and barricade the entrance! so much death. what can men do against such reckless hate? ride out with me. ride out and meet them. for death and glory. for rohan. for your people. the sun is rising. look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. at dawn  look to the east. yes. yes. the horn of helm hammerhand  shall sound in the deep  one last time. yes! let this be the hour when we draw swords together. fell deeds, awake. now for wrath  now for ruin and a red dawn. forth eorlingas! gandalf. theoden king stands alone. not alone. rohirrim! eomer. to the king! yes! a hit. a fine hit. break the dam! release the river! pippin! hold on! hold on, little hobbits. what are you doing? where are you going? it\\'s me. it\\'s your sam. don\\'t you know your sam? i can\\'t do this, sam. i know. it\\'s all wrong. by rights, we shouldn\\'t even be here. but we are. it\\'s like in the great stories, mr. frodo. the ones that really mattered. full of darkness and danger they were. and sometimes you didn\\'t want to know the end  because how could the end be happy? how could the world go back to the way it was  when so much bad had happened? victory! we have victory! but in the end, it\\'s only a passing thing  this shadow. even darkness must pass. a new day will come. and when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer. those were the stories that stayed with you  that meant something. even if you were too small to understand why. but i think, mr. frodo, i do understand. i know now. folk in those stories  had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn\\'t. they kept going  because they were holding on to something. what are we holding on to, sam? that there\\'s some good in this world, mr. frodo. and it\\'s worth fighting for. i think at last we understand one another, frodo baggins. you know the laws of our country, the laws of your father. if you let them go, your life will be forfeit. then it is forfeit. release them. stay out of the forest! keep away from the trees! final count  42 forty-two? oh, that\\'s not bad for a pointy-eared elvish princeling. i myself am sitting pretty on 43. forty-three. he was already dead. he was twitching. he was twitching  because he\\'s got my ax embedded in his nervous system! he doesn\\'t look too happy, does he? not too happy at all, merry. still, i suppose the view would be quite nice from up there. oh, yes. it\\'s a quality establishment. i hear the staff are very good. what are you doing? nothing. the world\\'s back to normal, that\\'s all. no, it isn\\'t. i\\'m starving. good luck trying to find something decent to eat around here. probably only dead rats and moldy bread. saruman\\'s storeroom! i don\\'t believe it. it can\\'t be. it is! longbottom leaf. the finest pipe-weed in the south farthing. it\\'s perfect. one barrel each. wait. do you think we should share it with treebeard? share it? no. no. dead plant and all that. don\\'t think he\\'d understand. could be a distant relative. oh, i get it. don\\'t be hasty. exactly. bar-hrum. this is the old sewer. runs right under the river through to the edge of the city. you\\'ll find cover in the woods there. captain faramir  you have shown your quality, sir. the very highest. the shire must truly be a great realm, master gamgee  where gardeners are held in high honor. what road will you take once you reach the woods? gollum says there\\'s a path  near minas morgul that climbs up into the mountains. cirith ungol? is that its name? no. no! yes. frodo  they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above minas morgul. you cannot go that way. it is the only way. master says we must go to mordor, so we must try. i must. go, frodo. go with the goodwill of all men. thank you. may death find you quickly if you bring them to harm. come on, keep up. mr. frodo didn\\'t mean for them rangers to hurt you. you know that, don\\'t you? he was trying to save you, see? save me? so there\\'s no hard feelings. forgive and forget. no, no, no hard feelings. gollum, gollum. yes, master. nice hobbits. very decent of you. very decent, indeed, gollum. sauron\\'s wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift. the battle for helm\\'s deep is over. the battle for middle-earth is about to begin. all our hopes now lie with two little hobbits  somewhere in the wilderness. i wonder if we\\'ll ever be put into songs or tales. what? i wonder if people will ever say, \"let\\'s hear about frodo and the ring.\" and they\\'ll say, \"yes! that\\'s one of my favorite stories.\" frodo was really courageous, wasn\\'t he, dad? yes, my boy. the most famousest of hobbits. and that\\'s saying a lot. well, you\\'ve left out one of the chief characters: samwise the brave. i want to hear more about sam. frodo wouldn\\'t have got far without sam. now, mr. frodo, you shouldn\\'t make fun. i was being serious. so was i. samwise the brave. smeagol? we\\'re not going to wait for you. come on. master. master looks after us. master wouldn\\'t hurt us. master broke his promise. don\\'t ask smeagol. poor, poor smeagol. master betrayed us. wicked. tricksy. false. we ought to wring his filthy little neck. kill him! kill him! kill them both! and then we take the precious  and we be the master! but the fat hobbit, he knows. eyes always watching. then we stabs them out. put out his eyeses and make him crawl. yes. yes. yes. kill them both. yes. no! no! it\\'s too risky. it\\'s too risky. where is he? where has he gone? hey, gollum! where are you? smeagol? we could let her do it. yes. she could do it. yes, precious, she could. and then we takes it once they\\'re dead. once they\\'re dead. come on, hobbits. long ways to go yet. smeagol will show you the way. follow me.'"

i\\'ve gone and had too much. must be getting late. no. it isn\\'t. it isn\\'t midday yet. the days are growing darker. come on! must go! no time! not before mr. frodo\\'s had something to eat. no time to lose, silly. here. what about you? oh, no, i\\'m not hungry. leastways, not for lembas bread. sam. all right. we don\\'t have that much left. we have to be careful or we\\'re going to run out. you go ahead and eat that, mr. frodo. i\\'ve rationed it. there should be enough. for what? the journey home. come, hobbitses. very close now. very close to mordor. no safe places here. hurry. it\\'s good. definitely from the shire. longbottom leaf. i feel like i\\'m back at the green dragon. green dragon. a mug of ale in my hand. putting my feet up on a settle after a hard day\\'s work. only, you\\'ve never done a hard day\\'s work. welcome, my lords  to isengard! you young rascals! a merry hunt you\\'ve led us on  and now we find you feasting and and smoking! we are sitting on a field of victory  enjoying a few well-earned comforts. the salted pork is particularly good. salted pork? hobbits. we\\'re under orders from treebeard  who\\'s taken over management of isengard. young master gandalf. i\\'m glad you\\'ve come. wood and water, stock and stone i can master. but there is a wizard to manage here  locked in his tower. show yourself. be careful. even in defeat, saruman is dangerous. well, let\\'s just have his head and be done with it. no. we need him alive. we need him to talk. you have fought many wars and slain many men, theoden king  and made peace afterwards. can we not take counsel together as we once did, my old friend? can we not have peace, you and i? we shall have peace. we shall have peace  when you answer for the burning of the westfold  and the children that lie dead there! we shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers  whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead  against the gates of the hornburg, are avenged! when you hang from a gibbet for the sport of your own crows  we shall have peace. gibbets and crows? dotard! what do you want, gandalf greyhame? let me guess. the key of orthanc. or perhaps the keys of barad-dur itself  along with the crowns of the seven kings and the rods of the five wizards! your treachery has already cost many lives. thousands more are now at risk. but you could save them, saruman. you were deep in the enemy\\'s counsel. so you have come here for information. i have some for you. something festers in the heart of middle-earth. something that you have failed to see. but the great eye has seen it. even now he presses his advantage. his attack will come soon. you\\'re all going to die. but you know this, don\\'t you, gandalf? you cannot think that this ranger will ever sit upon the throne of gondor. this exile, crept from the shadows, will never be crowned king. gandalf does not hesitate to sacrifice those closest to him  those he professes to love. tell me, what words of comfort did you give the halfling  before you sent him to his doom? the path that you have set him on can only lead to death. i\\'ve heard enough! shoot him. stick an arrow in his gob. no. come down, saruman  and your life will be spared. save your pity and your mercy. i have no use for it! saruman  your staff is broken. grima, you need not follow him. you were not always as you are now. you were once a man of rohan. come down. a man of rohan? what is the house of rohan  but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek  and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs? the victory at helm\\'s deep does not belong to you, theoden horse-master. you are a lesser son of greater sires. grima  come down. be free of him. free? he will never be free. no. get down, cur! saruman! you were deep in the enemy\\'s counsel. tell us what you know! you withdraw your guard, and i will tell you where your doom will be decided. i will not be held prisoner here. send word to all our allies  and to every corner of middle-earth that still stands free. the enemy moves against us. we need to know where he will strike. the filth of saruman  is washing away. trees will come back to live here. young trees. wild trees. pippin! bless my bark! peregrin took! i\\'ll take that, my lad. quickly, now. tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country. hail the victorious dead. hail! no pauses. no spills. and no regurgitation. so it\\'s a drinking game? last one standing wins. what\\'ll we drink to? let\\'s drink to victory! to victory! westu, aragorn, hal. i am happy for you. he is an honorable man. you are both honorable men. it was not theoden of rohan who led our people to victory. ah, don\\'t listen to me. you are young. and tonight is for you. here, here. it\\'s the dwarves that go swimming with little, hairy women. i feel something. a slight tingle in my fingers. i think it\\'s affecting me. what did i say? he can\\'t hold his liquor. game over. oh, you can search far and wide you can drink the whole town dry but you\\'ll never find a beer so brown but you\\'ll never find a beer so brown as the one we drink in our hometown/but you\\'ll never find a beer so brown as the one we drink in our hometown you can drink your fancy ales you can drink them by the flagon but the only brew for the brave and true pippin! but the only brew for the brave and true comes from the green dragon thank you! i win! no news of frodo? no word. nothing. we have time. every day, frodo moves closer to mordor. do we know that? what does your heart tell you? that frodo is alive. yes. yes, he\\'s alive. too risky. too risky. thieves. they stole it from us. kill them. kill them. kill them both. shh! quiet! mustn\\'t wake them. mustn\\'t ruin it now. but they knows. they knows. they suspects us. what\\'s it saying, my precious, my love? is smeagol losing his nerve? no. not. never. smeagol hates nasty hobbitses. smeagol wants to see them dead. and we will. smeagol did it once. he can do it again. it\\'s ours! ours! we must get the precious. we must get it back. patience! patience, my love. first we must lead them to her. we lead them to the winding stair. yes, the stairs. and then? up, up, up, up, up the stairs we go  until we come to the tunnel. and when they go in  there\\'s no coming out. she\\'s always hungry. she always needs to feed. she must eat. all she gets is filthy orcses. and they doesn\\'t taste very nice, does they, precious? no. not very nice at all, my love. she hungers for sweeter meats. hobbit meat. and when she throws away the bones and the empty clothes  then we will find it. and take it for me! for us. yes. we meant ”for us.” gollum. gollum. the precious will be ours  once the hobbitses are dead! you treacherous little toad! no! no! master! no, sam! leave him alone! i heard it from his own mouth. he means to murder us. never! smeagol wouldn\\'t hurt a fly. he\\'s a horrid, fat hobbit  who hates smeagol  and who makes up nasty lies. you miserable little maggot! i\\'ll stove your head in! sam! call me a liar? you\\'re a liar! you scare him off, we\\'re lost! i don\\'t care! i can\\'t do it, mr. frodo. i won\\'t wait around for him to kill us! i\\'m not sending him away. you don\\'t see it, do you? he\\'s a villain. we can\\'t do this by ourselves, sam. not without a guide. i need you on my side. i\\'m on your side, mr. frodo. i know, sam. i know. trust me. come, smeagol. what time is it? not yet dawn. i dreamed i saw a great wave  climbing over green lands and above the hills. i stood upon the brink. it was utterly dark in the abyss before my feet. a light shone behind me  but i could not turn. i could only stand there, waiting. night changes many thoughts. sleep, eowyn. sleep  while you can. the stars are veiled. something stirs in the east. a sleepless malice. the eye of the enemy is moving. what are you doing? pippin! pippin? pippin. are you mad? i just want to look at it. just one more time. put it back. pippin. no! pippin. he is here. i see you. pippin! help! gandalf, help! someone help him! pippin! fool of a took! look at me. gandalf, forgive me. look at me. what did you see? a tree. there was a white tree  in a courtyard of stone. it was dead. the city was burning. minas tirith? is that what you saw? i saw  i saw him. i could hear hisice in my head. and what did you tell him? speak! he asked me my name. i didn\\'t answer. he hurt me. what did you tell him about frodo and the ring? there was no lie in pippin\\'s eyes. a fool  but an honest fool he remains. he told sauron nothing of frodo and the ring. we\\'ve been strangely fortunate. pippin saw in the palantir a glimpse of the enemy\\'s plan. sauron moves to strike the city of minas tirith. his defeat at helm\\'s deep showed our enemy one thing. he knows the heir of elendil has come forth. men are not as weak as he supposed. there is courage still, strength enough perhaps to challenge him. sauron fears this. he will not risk the peoples of middle-earth uniting under one banner. he will raze minas tirith to the ground  before he sees a king return to the throne of men. if the beacons of gondor are lit, rohan must be ready for war. tell me  why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours? what do we owe gondor? i will go. no! they must be warned. they will be. you must come to minas tirith by another road. follow the river. look to the black ships. understand this: things are now in motion that cannot be undone. i ride for minas tirith  and i won\\'t be going alone. of all the inquisitive hobbits, peregrin took, you are the worst. hurry! hurry! where are we going? why did you look? why do you always have to look? i don\\'t know. i can\\'t help it. you never can. i\\'m sorry, all right? i won\\'t do it again. don\\'t you understand? the enemy thinks you have the ring. he\\'s going to be looking for you, pip. they have to get you out of here. and you ? you\\'re coming with me? merry? come on. how far is minas tirith? three days\\' ride, as the nazgul flies. and you better hope we don\\'t have one of those on our tail. here. something for the road. the last of the longbottom leaf. i know you\\'ve run out. you smoke too much, pip. but but we\\'ll see each other soon. won\\'t we? i don\\'t know. i don\\'t know what\\'s going to happen. merry. run, shadowfax. show us the meaning of haste. merry! merry! he\\'s always followed me  everywhere i went  since before we were tweens. i would get him into the worst sort of trouble  but i was always there to get him out. now he\\'s gone. just like frodo and sam. one thing i have learned about hobbits: they\\'re a most hardy folk. foolhardy, maybe. he\\'s a took. take her by the safest road. a ship lies anchored in the grey havens. it waits to carry her across the sea. the last journey of arwen undomiel. there is nothing for you here  only death. lady arwen  we cannot delay. my lady! tell me what you have seen. arwen. you have the gift of foresight. what did you see? i looked into your future, and i saw death. but there is also life. you saw there was a child. you saw my son. that future is almost gone. but it is not lost. nothing is certain. some things are certain. if i leave him now  i will regret it forever. it is time. from the ashes a fire shall be woken a light from the shadow shall spring renewed shall be blade that was broken the crownless again shall be king re-forge the sword. ada. your hands are cold. the life of the eldar is leaving you. this was my choice. ada, whether by your will or not  there is no ship now that can bear me hence. we\\'ve just passed into the realm of gondor. minas tirith. city of kings. make way! it\\'s the tree. gandalf. gandalf. yes, the white tree of gondor. the tree of the king. lord denethor, however, is not king. he is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne. now listen carefully. lord denethor is boromir\\'s father. to give him news of his beloved son\\'s death would be most unwise. and do not mention frodo or the ring. and say nothing of aragorn either. in fact, it\\'s better if you don\\'t speak at all, peregrin took. hail denethor, son of ecthelion, lord and steward of gondor. i come with tidings in this dark hour, and with counsel. perhaps you come to explain this. perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead. boromir died to save us  my kinsman and me. he fell defending us from many foes. pippin. i offer you my service, such as it is  in payment of this debt. this is my first command to you. how did you escape and my son did not  so mighty a man as he was? the mightiest man may be slain by one arrow  and boromir was pierced by many. get up. my lord, there will be a time to grieve for boromir  but it is not now. war is coming. the enemy is on your doorstep. as steward, you are charged  with the defense of this city. where are gondor\\'s armies? you still have friends. you are not alone in this fight. send word to theoden of rohan. light the beacons. you think you are wise, mithrandir. yet for all your subtleties, you have not wisdom. do you think the eyes of the white tower are blind? i have seen more than you know. with your left hand you would use me as a shield against mordor. and with your right you\\'d seek to supplant me. i know who rides with theoden of rohan. oh, yes. word has reached my ears of this aragorn, son of arathorn. and i tell you now, i will not bow to this ranger from the north  last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship. authority is not given to you to deny the return of the king, steward. the rule of gondor is mine and no other\\'s. come. all has turned to vain ambition. he would even use his grief as a cloak. a thousand years this city has stood. now, at the whim of a madman, it will fall. and the white tree, the tree of the king  will never bloom again. why are they still guarding it? they guard it because they have hope. a faint and fading hope that one day it will flower. that a king will come and this city will be as it once was  before it fell into decay. the old wisdom borne out of the west was forsaken. kings made tombs more splendid than the houses of the living  and counted the old names of their descent  dearer than the names of their sons. childless lords sat in aged halls, musing on heraldry  or in high, cold towers, asking questions of the stars. and so the people of gondor fell into ruin. the line of kings failed. the white tree withered. the rule of gondor was given over to lesser men. mordor. yes, there it lies. this city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow. a storm is coming. this is not the weather of the world. this is a device of sauron\\'s making. a broil of fume he sends ahead of his host. the orcs of mordor have no love of daylight  so he covers the face of the sun  to ease their passage along the road to war. when the shadow of mordor reaches this city  it will begin. well  minas tirith  very impressive. so where are we off to next? oh, it\\'s too late for that, peregrin. there\\'s no leaving this city. help must come to us. it must be getting near teatime. leastways, it would be in decent places where there is still teatime. we\\'re not in decent places. mr. frodo? what is it? it\\'s just a feeling. i don\\'t think i\\'ll be coming back. yes, you will. of course you will. that\\'s just morbid thinking. we\\'re going there and back again  just like mr. bilbo. you\\'ll see. i think these lands were once part of the kingdom of gondor. long ago, when there was a king. mr. frodo, look. the king has got a crown again. come on, hobbits! mustn\\'t stop now. this way. so i imagine this is just a ceremonial position. i mean, they don\\'t actually expect me to do any fighting. do they? you\\'re in the service of the steward now. you\\'ll have to do as you\\'re told, peregrin took. ridiculous hobbit. guard of the citadel. thank you. there\\'s no more stars. is it time? yes. it\\'s so quiet. it\\'s the deep breath before the plunge. i don\\'t want to be in a battle  but waiting on the edge of one i can\\'t escape is even worse. is there any hope, gandalf, for frodo and sam? there never was much hope. just a fool\\'s hope. our enemy is ready. his full strength\\'s gathered. not only orcs, but men as well. legions of haradrim from the south  mercenaries from the coast. all will answer mordor\\'s call. come on. this will be the end of gondor as we know it. here the hammer stroke will fall hardest. if the river is taken, if the garrison at osgiliath falls  the last defense of this city will be gone. but we have the white wizard. that\\'s got to count for something. gandalf? sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant  the one who will lead mordor\\'s armies in war. the one they say no living man can kill. the witch king of angmar. you\\'ve met him before. he stabbed frodo on weathertop. he is the lord of the nazgul  the greatest of the nine. minas morgul is his lair. the dead city. very nasty place. full of enemies. quick. quick. they will see. they will see. come away. come away. look, we have found it. the way into mordor. the secret stair. climb. no, mr. frodo! not that way! what\\'s it doing? no. they\\'re calling me. no. hide! hide! i can feel his blade. we come to it at last. the great battle of our time. come away, hobbits. we climb. we must climb. the board is set. the pieces are moving. up, up, up the stairs we go. and then it\\'s into the tunnel. hey, what\\'s in this tunnel? you listen to me, and you listen good and proper. anything happens to him, you have me to answer to. one sniff something\\'s not right  one hair stands up on the back of my head, it\\'s over. no more slinker. no more stinker. you\\'re gone. got it? i\\'m watching you. what was that about? nothing. just clearing something up. peregrin took, my lad, there is a task now to be done. another opportunity for one of the shire-folk to prove their great worth. you must not fail me. it\\'s been very quiet across the river. the orcs are lying low. the garrison may have moved out. we\\'ve sent scouts to cair andros. if the orcs attack from the north, we\\'ll have some warning. quiet. we need 10 more. kill him! they\\'re not coming from the north. to the river. quick. quick. go. come on. faster. draw swords. hold! hold them! what? amon din the beacon. the beacon of amon din is lit. hope is kindled. the beacons of minas tirith! the beacons are lit! gondor calls for aid. and rohan will answer. muster the rohirrim. assemble the army at dunharrow. as many men as can be found. you have two days. on the third, we ride for gondor and war. forward. very good, sir. gamling. my lord. make haste across the riddermark. summon every able-bodied man to dunharrow. i will. will you ride with us? just to the encampment. it\\'s tradition for the women of the court to farewell the men. the men have found their captain. they will follow you into battle, even to death. you have given us hope. excuse me. i have a sword. please accept it. i offer you my service, theoden king. and gladly i accept it. you shall be meriadoc, esquire of rohan. horse-men. i wish i could muster a legion of dwarves, fully armed and filthy. your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war. i fear war already marches on their own lands. so it is before the walls of minas tirith  the doom of our time will be decided. now is the hour. riders of rohan, oaths you have taken. now, fulfill them all. to lord and land! ya! faramir! we can\\'t hold them. the city is lost. tell the men to break cover. we ride for minas tirith. nazgul. take cover! nazgul! fall back. fall back to minas tirith! fall back! retreat! retreat! run for your lives! the age of men is over. the time of the orc has come. keep going. it\\'s the nazgul. take cover, my lord! it\\'s coming! it\\'s mithrandir. the white rider! pull! mithrandir. they broke through our defenses. they\\'ve taken the bridge and the west bank. battalions of orcs are crossing the river. it is as the lord denethor predicted. long has he foreseen this doom. foreseen and done nothing. faramir? this is not the first halfling to have crossed your path. no. you\\'ve seen frodo and sam? where? when? in ithilien. not two days ago. gandalf, they\\'re taking the road to the morgul vale. and then the pass of cirith ungol. what does that mean? what\\'s wrong? faramir, tell me everything. tell me all you know. this is how you would serve your city? you would risk its utter ruin? i did what i judged to be right. what you judged to be right. you sent the ring of power into mordor in the hands of a witless halfling. it should have been brought back to the citadel to be kept safe. hidden. dark and deep in the vaults  not to be used. unless at the uttermost end of need. i would not use the ring. not if minas tirith were falling in ruin and i alone could save her. ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious  as a king of old. boromir would have remembered his father\\'s need. he would have brought me a kingly gift. boromir would not have brought the ring. he would have stretched out his hand to this thing and taken it. he would\\'ve fallen. you know nothing of this matter! he would have kept it for his own. and when he returned  you would not have known your son. boromir was loyal to me! not some wizard\\'s pupil! father? my son. leave me. careful, master. careful. very far to fall. very dangerous are the stairs. come, master. come to smeagol. mr. frodo. get back, you! don\\'t touch him! why does he hates poor smeagol? what has smeagol ever done to him? master? master carries heavy burden. smeagol knows. heavy, heavy burden. fat one cannot know. smeagol look after master. he wants it. he needs it. smeagol sees it in his eye. very soon he will ask you for it. you will see. the fat one will take it from you. send forth all legions. do not stop the attack until the city is taken. slay them all. what of the wizard? i will break him. where are theoden\\'s riders? will rohan\\'s army come? mithrandir. courage is the best defense that you have now. what were you thinking, peregrin took? what service can a hobbit offer such a great lord of men? it was well-done. a generous deed should not be checked with cold counsel. you are to join the tower guard. i didn\\'t think they would find any livery that would fit me. it once belonged to a young boy of the city. a very foolish one  who wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending to his studies. this was yours? yes, it was mine. my father had it made for me. well  i\\'m taller than you were then. though i\\'m not likely to grow anymore, except sideways. never fitted me either. boromir was always the soldier. they were so alike, he and my father. proud. stubborn even. but strong. i think you have strength of a different kind. and one day your father will see it. here do i swear fealty and service to gondor  in peace or war  in living or dying  from  from this hour henceforth  until my lord release me  or death take me. and i shall not forget it  nor fail to reward that which is given. fealty with love. valor with honor. disloyalty with vengeance. i do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defenses  defenses that your brother long held intact. what would you have me do? i will not yield  the river in pelennor unfought. osgiliath must be retaken. my lord, osgiliath is overrun. much must be risked in war. is there a captain here who still has the courage to do his lord\\'s will? you wish now that our places had been exchanged  that i had died and boromir had lived. yes. i wish that. since you were robbed of boromir  i will do what i can in his stead. if i should return, think better of me, father. that will depend on the manner of your return. what are you up to? sneaking off, are we? sneaking? sneaking? fat hobbit is always so polite. smeagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find  and they say “sneak.” sneak? very nice friend. oh, yes, my precious. very nice, very nice. all right. all right! you just startled me is all. what were you doing? sneaking. fine. have it your own way. i\\'m sorry to wake you, mr. frodo. we have to be moving on. it\\'s dark still. it\\'s always dark here. it\\'s gone! the elven bread. what? that\\'s all we have left. he took it. he must have! smeagol? no, no, not poor smeagol. smeagol hates nasty elf bread. you\\'re a lying rat! what did you do with it?! he doesn\\'t eat it. he can\\'t have taken it. look. what\\'s this? crumbs on his jacketses. he took it! he took it. i seen him. he\\'s always stuffing his face when master\\'s not looking. that\\'s a filthy lie! you stinking, two-faced sneak! sam! call me  stop it! sam! i\\'ll kill him! sam! no! oh, my i\\'m sorry. i didn\\'t mean it to go so far. i was just so so angry. here, just let\\'s just rest a bit. i\\'m all right. no. no, you\\'re not all right. you\\'re exhausted. it\\'s that gollum. it\\'s this place. it\\'s that thing around your neck. i could help a bit. i could carry it for a while. carry it for a while. i could carry it i could carry it. share the load share the load the load the load. get away! i don\\'t want to keep it. i just want to help. see? see? he wants it for himself. shut up, you! go away! get out of here! no, sam. it\\'s you. i\\'m sorry, sam. but he\\'s a liar. he\\'s poisoned you against me. you can\\'t help me anymore. you don\\'t mean that. go home. faramir! faramir! your father\\'s will has turned to madness. do not throw away your life so rashly. where does my allegiance lie if not here? this is the city of the men of numenor. i will gladly give my life to defend her beauty  her memory, her wisdom. your father loves you, faramir. he will remember it before the end. can you sing, master hobbit? well  yes. at least, well enough for my own people. but we have no songs for great halls  and evil times. and why should your songs be unfit for my halls? come, sing me a song. home is behind the world ahead and there are many paths to tread through shadow to the edge of night until the stars are all alight mist and shadow cloud and shade all shall fade all shall fade march! march! march! march! march! make way for the king. make way. the king is here. my lord. hail to you, sire. grimbold, how many? i bring 500 men from the westfold, my lord. we have 300 more from fenmarch, theoden king. where are the riders from snowborn? none have come, my lord. six thousand spears. less than half of what i\\'d hoped for. six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of mordor. more will come. every hour lost hastens gondor\\'s defeat. we have till dawn, then we must ride. the horses are restless  and the men are quiet. they grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain. that road there  where does that lead? it is the road to the dimholt, the door under the mountain. none who venture there ever return. that mountain is evil. aragorn. let\\'s find some food. there. a true esquire of rohan. i\\'m ready. sorry. it isn\\'t all that dangerous. it\\'s not even sharp. well, that\\'s no good. you won\\'t kill many orcs with a blunt blade. come on. to the smithy. go! you should not encourage him. you should not doubt him. i do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm. why should merry be left behind? he has as much cause to go to war as you. why can he not fight for those he loves? you know as little of war as that hobbit. when the fear takes him  and the blood and the screams and the horror of battle take hold  do you think he would stand and fight? he would flee. and he would be right to do so. war is the province of men, eowyn. i choose a mortal life. i wish i could\\'ve seen him  one last time. sir? king theoden awaits you, my lord. i take my leave. my lord elrond. i come on behalf of one whom i love. arwen is dying. she will not long survive the evil that now spreads from mordor. the light of the evenstar is failing. as sauron\\'s power grows, her strength wanes. arwen\\'s life is now tied to the fate of the ring. the shadow is upon us, aragorn. the end has come. it will not be our end, but his. you ride to war, but not to victory. sauron\\'s armies march on minas tirith, this you know. but in secret he sends another force which will attack from the river. a fleet of corsair ships sails from the south. they\\'ll be in the city in two days. you\\'re outnumbered, aragorn. you need more men. there are none. there are those who dwell in the mountain. murderers  traitors. you would call upon them to fight? they believe in nothing. they answer to no one. they will answer to the king of gondor. anduril, the flame of the west, forged from the shards of narsil. sauron will not have forgotten the sword of elendil. the blade that was broken shall return to minas tirith. the man who can wield the power of this sword  can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth. put aside the ranger. become who you were born to be. take the dimholt road. i give hope to men. i keep none for myself. why are you doing this? the war lies to the east. you cannot leave on the eve of battle. you cannot abandon the men. eowyn  we need you here. why have you come? do you not know? it is but a shadow and a thought that you love. i cannot give you what you seek. i have wished you joy since first i saw you. just where do you think you\\'re off to? not this time. this time you must stay, gimli. have you learned nothing of the stubbornness of dwarves? you might as well accept it. we\\'re going with you, laddie. what\\'s happening?  where is he going? where\\'s he going? i don\\'t understand. lord aragorn! why does he leave on the eve of battle? he leaves because there is no hope. he leaves because he must. too few have come. we cannot defeat the armies of mordor. no  we cannot. but we will meet them in battle nonetheless. i have left instruction. the people are to follow your rule in my stead. take up my seat in the golden hall. long may you defend edoras  if the battle goes ill. what other duty would you have me do, my lord? duty? no. i would have you smile again  not grieve for those whose time has come. you shall live to see these days renewed  and no more despair. what kind of army would linger in such a place? one that is cursed. long ago, the men of the mountains swore an oath  to the last king of gondor  to come to his aid  to fight. but when the time came  when gondor\\'s need was dire  they fled  vanishing into the darkness of the mountain. and so isildur cursed them  never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge. who shall call them from the grey twilight? the forgotten people. the heir of him to whom the oath they swore. from the north shall he come. need shall drive him. he shall pass the door to the paths of the dead. the very warmth of my blood seems stolen away. the way is shut. it was made by those who are dead. and the dead keep it. the way is shut. brego! i do not fear death. well, this is a thing unheard-of. an elf will go underground where a dwarf dare not? oh. oh, i\\'d never hear the end of it. we must ride light and swift. it is a long road ahead. and man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight. little hobbits do not belong in war, master meriadoc. all my friends have gone to battle. i would be ashamed to be left behind. it is a three-day gallop to minas tirith. and none of my riders can bear you as a burden. i want to fight. i will say no more. ride with me. my lady. form up! move out! form up! move out! ride! ride now to gondor! what is it? what do you see? i see shapes of men. and of horses. where? pale banners like shreds of cloud. spears rise  like winter-thickets through a shroud of mist. the dead are following. they have been summoned. the dead? summoned? i knew that. very good. very good! legolas! do not look down. who enters my domain? one who will have your allegiance. the dead do not suffer the living to pass. you will suffer me. the way is shut. it was made by those who are dead. and the dead keep it. the way is shut. now you must die. i summon you to fulfill your oath. none but the king of gondor may command me. that line was broken. it has been remade. fight for us  and regain your honor. what say you? what say you? you waste your time, aragorn. they had no honor in life, they have none now in death. i am isildur\\'s heir. fight for me  and i will hold your oaths fulfilled. what say you? you have my word! fight, and i will release you from this living death! what say you?! stand, you traitors! out! legolas! run! we fight. open the gate! quick! quick! hurry! faramir! say not that he has fallen. they were outnumbered. none survived. fear. the city is rank with it. let us ease their pain. release the prisoners. catapults! my sons are spent. my line has ended. he\\'s alive! the house of stewards has failed. he needs medicine, my lord. my line has ended! my lord! rohan  has deserted us. theoden\\'s betrayed me. abandon your posts! flee! flee for your lives! prepare for battle! hurry, men! to the wall! defend the wall! over here! return to your posts! send these foul beasts into the abyss. stay where you are. we need more rubble! watch out! down to the lower levels. quick! double up, men! hold them back! do not give in to fear. stand to your posts! fight! not at the towers! aim for the trolls! kill the trolls! bring them down! fight them back! peregrin took! go back to the citadel! they\\'d called us out to fight. this is no place for a hobbit. guard of the citadel, indeed. now, back, up the hill. quickly. quick! what are you doing, you useless scum?! the door won\\'t give. it\\'s too strong. get back there and smash it down. but nothing can breach it. grond will breach it. bring up the wolf\\'s head. grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! you may go no further. you will not enter gondor. who are you to deny us passage?

orcses\\' filth. orcses come in here sometimes. hurry. this way. smeagol? over here. it\\'s sticky. what is it? you\\'ll see. oh, yes. you will see. smeagol? smeagol! smeagol! sam. and you, frodo baggins  i give you the light of earendil, our most beloved star. may it be a light for you in dark places  when all other lights go out. hail earendil brightest of the stars! naughty little fly. why does he cry? caught in a web soon you\\'ll be  eaten. got away, did it, precious? not this time. not this time! no! it wasn\\'t us. it wasn\\'t us! smeagol wouldn\\'t hurt master. we promised. you must believe us. it was the precious. the precious made us do it. i have to destroy it, smeagol. i have to destroy it for both our sakes. no! i\\'m so sorry, sam. i\\'m so sorry. this task was appointed to you, frodo of the shire. if you do not find a way  no one will. the scouts report minas tirith is surrounded. the lower level\\'s in flames. everywhere, legions of the enemy advance. time is against us. make ready! take heart, merry. it will soon be over. my lady  you are fair and brave  and have much to live for  and many who love you. i know it is too late to turn aside. i know there is not much point now in hoping. if i were a knight of rohan, capable of great deeds  but - i\\'m not. i\\'m a hobbit. and i know i can\\'t save middle-earth. i just want to help my friends. frodo. sam. pippin. more than anything, i wish i could see them again. prepare to move out! make haste. we ride through the night. to battle. to battle. back to the gate! hurry! i am steward of the house of anarion. thus have i walked. and thus now will i sleep. gondor is lost. there is no hope for men. why do the fools fly? better to die sooner than late. for die we must. no tomb for denethor and faramir. no long, slow sleep of death embalmed. we shall burn, like the heathen kings of old. bring wood and oil. steady. steady. you are soldiers of gondor. no matter what comes through that gate, you will stand your ground. run! volley! fire! let him go, you filth. let him go! you will not touch him again. come on and finish it. back! mr. frodo. oh, no. frodo. mr. frodo. wake up. don\\'t leave me here alone. don\\'t go where i can\\'t follow. wake up. not asleep. dead. you get back, you scum! what\\'s this?

see what? white shores  and beyond. a far green country  under a swift sunrise. well  that isn\\'t so bad. no. no, it isn\\'t. rally to me! to me! feast on his flesh. i will kill you if you touch him. do not come between the nazgul and his prey. late as usual, pirate scum! there\\'s knife-work here needs doing. come on, you sea rats! get off your ships! there\\'s plenty for the both of us. may the best dwarf win. you fool. no man can kill me. die now. i am no man. 15! 16! 17! merry! legolas! 33, 34. that still only counts as one! come on, then. come on! i know your face  eowyn. my eyes darken. no. no. i am going to save you. you already did. eowyn  my body is broken. you have to let me go. i go to my fathers  in whose mighty company  i shall not now feel ashamed. eowyn. release us. bad idea. very handy in a tight spot, these lads, despite the fact they\\'re dead. you gave us your word. i hold your oath fulfilled. go. be at peace. merry. no! no! merry! merry! merry. merry, it\\'s me. it\\'s pippin. i knew you\\'d find me. yes. are you going to leave me? no, merry. i\\'m going to look after you. hands off! that shiny shirt, that\\'s mine. it\\'s going to the great eye, along with everything else. i don\\'t take orders from stinking morgul-rats! you touch it, and i\\'ll stick this blade in your gut. the scum tried to knife me. kill him! that\\'s for frodo! and for the shire! and that\\'s for my old gaffer! stop your squealing, you dunghill rat. i\\'m gonna bleed you like a stuck pig. not if i stick you first. sam! oh, sam, i\\'m so sorry. sorry for everything. let\\'s get you out of here. it\\'s too late. it\\'s over. they\\'ve taken it. sam  they took the ring. begging your pardon, but they haven\\'t. i thought i\\'d lost you. so i took it. only for safekeeping. give it to me. give me the ring, sam. sam. give me the ring. you must understand. the ring is my burden. it will destroy you, sam. come on, mr. frodo. we best find you some clothes. you can\\'t go walking through mordor in naught but your skin. we did it, mr. frodo. we made it to mordor. there are so many of them. we\\'ll never get through unseen. it\\'s him, the eye. we have to go in there, mr. frodo. there\\'s nothing for it. come on. let\\'s just make it down the hill for starters. frodo has passed beyond my sight. the darkness is deepening. if sauron had the ring, we would know it. it\\'s only a matter of time. he has suffered a defeat, yes but  behind the walls of mordor, our enemy is regrouping. let him stay there. let him rot! why should we care? because 10,000 orcs now stand between frodo and mount doom. i\\'ve sent him to his death. no. there is still hope for frodo. he needs time and safe passage across the plains of gorgoroth. we can give him that. how? draw out sauron\\'s armies. empty his lands. then we gather our full strength and march on the black gate. we cannot achieve victory through strength of arms. not for ourselves. but we can give frodo his chance if we keep sauron\\'s eye fixed upon us. keep him blind to all else that moves. a diversion. certainty of death  small chance of success  what are we waiting for? sauron will suspect a trap. he will not take the bait. oh, i think he will. long have you hunted me. long have i eluded you. no more. behold the sword of elendil. the city has fallen silent. there is no warmth left in the sun. it grows so cold. it\\'s just the damp of the first spring rain. i do not believe this darkness will endure. look, the orcs  they\\'re moving off. you see, mr. frodo  some luck at last. move it, you slugs! come on! faster! come along, you coldhearted wretched scum  i\\'ll whip you down to the bone, you  come on! what have i told you? no evasion. now move it! get up! come on, you slugs! you two are going straight to the front line! now, move it! go on! fall in! move it! move it! move it! to the gate, you slugs! now, move it! faster! don\\'t you know we\\'re at war? company, halt! inspection! sam, help me. mr. frodo! stand up, mr. frodo. stand up! it\\'s so heavy. oh, no. what do i do? what do we do? hit me. what? hit me, sam. start fighting. get off of me! nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot. get off of me! break it up! break it up! oi! i\\'ll have your guts if you don\\'t shut this rabble down! go, sam. now! move along, scum! back in the line! you maggots! get back into the line, you slugs! dig it, you slugs. move it. i can\\'t  i can\\'t i can\\'t manage the ring, sam. it\\'s it\\'s  it\\'s such a weight to carry. it\\'s  such a weight. we\\'re going that way. straight as we can. there\\'s no point carrying anything we\\'re not sure to need. mr. frodo. look. there is light  and beauty up there  that no shadow can touch. take mine. there\\'s a few drops left. there will be none left for the return journey. i don\\'t think there will be a return journey, mr. frodo. frodo, get down! hide! frodo! where are they? let the lord of the black land come forth! let justice be done upon him! my master, sauron the great, bids thee welcome. is there any in this rout with authority to treat with me? we do not come to treat with sauron  faithless and accursed. tell your master this: the armies of mordor must disband. he is to depart these lands, never to return. old greybeard. i have a token i was bidden to show thee. frodo. frodo. silence. no! silence! the halfling was dear to thee, i see. know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host. who would\\'ve thought one so small could endure so much pain? and he did, gandalf. he did. and who is this? isildur\\'s heir? it takes more to make a king than a broken elvish blade. i guess that concludes negotiations. i do not believe it. i will not. pull back. pull back! it\\'s gone, mr. frodo. the light\\'s passed on, away towards the north. something\\'s drawn its gaze. hold your ground! hold your ground. sons of gondor, of rohan, my brothers! i see in your eyes  the same fear that would take the heart of me. a day may come when the courage of men fails  when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship. but it is not this day. an hour of wolves and shattered shields  when the age of men comes crashing down. but it is not this day. this day we fight! by all that you hold dear on this good earth  i bid you stand, men of the west! never thought i\\'d die fighting side by side with an elf. what about side by side with a friend? aye. i could do that. do you remember the shire, mr. frodo? it\\'ll be spring soon. and the orchards will be in blossom. and the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket. and they\\'ll be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields  and eating the first of the strawberries with cream. do you remember the taste of strawberries? no, sam. i can\\'t recall the taste of food  nor the sound of water  nor the touch of grass. i\\'m  naked in the dark. there\\'s there\\'s nothing. no veil between me and the wheel of fire. i can see him  with my waking eyes. then let us be rid of it  once and for all. come on, mr. frodo. i can\\'t carry it for you  but i can carry you. come on! aragorn. elessar. for frodo. look, mr. frodo. a doorway. we\\'re almost there. clever hobbits to climb so high! mustn\\'t go that way. mustn\\'t hurt the precious. you swore! you swore on the precious! smeagol promised! smeagol lied. frodo! eagles. the eagles are coming! frodo! i\\'m here, sam. destroy it! go on! now! throw it in the fire! what are you waiting for? just let it go! the ring is mine. no. no. no! yes! yes! precious! precious! precious! precious! give me your hand! take my hand! no! don\\'t you let go. don\\'t let go. reach! frodo! frodo! it\\'s gone. it\\'s done. yes, mr. frodo. it\\'s over now. i can see the shire. the brandywine river. bag end. gandalf\\'s fireworks. the lights in the party tree. rosie cotton dancing. she had ribbons in her hair. if ever i was to marry someone  it would\\'ve been her. it would\\'ve been her. i\\'m glad to be with you, samwise gamgee  here at the end of all things. gandalf? frodo! gimli! now come the days of the king. may they be blessed. this day does not belong to one man  but to all. let us together rebuild this world  that we may share in the days of peace. out of the great sea  to middle-earth i am come. in this place will i abide  and my heirs  unto the ending of the world. thank you. my friends  you bow to no one. and thus it was. a fourth age of middle-earth began. and the fellowship of the ring  though eternally bound by friendship and love  was ended. thirteen months to the day since gandalf sent us on our long journey  we found ourselves looking upon a familiar sight. we were home. hi. hey, watch the pumpkin. more of the same, rosie. good night, lads. how do you pick up the threads of an old life? how do you go on  when in your heart you begin to understand  there is no going back? there are some things that time cannot mend  some hurts that go too deep  that have taken hold. mr. frodo? what is it? it\\'s been four years to the day since weathertop, sam. it\\'s never really healed. “there and back again. a hobbit\\'s tale by bilbo baggins. and the lord of the rings by frodo baggins.\" you finished it. not quite. there\\'s room for a little more. bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end  that each of us must come and go in the telling. bilbo\\'s story was now over. there would be no more journeys for him  save one. tell me again, lad, where are we going? to the harbor, bilbo. the elves have accorded you a special honor  a place on the last ship to leave middle-earth. frodo  any chance of seeing that old ring of mine again? the one i gave you. i\\'m sorry, uncle. i\\'m afraid i lost it. oh. pity. i should like to have held it one last time. well, here\\'s a sight i have never seen before. the power of the three rings is ended. the time has come  for the dominion of men. the sea calls us home. i think i\\'m  quite ready for another adventure. farewell  my brave hobbits. my work is now finished. here at last, on the shores of the sea  comes the end of our fellowship. i will not say, “do not weep”  for not all tears are an evil. it is time, frodo. what does he mean? we set out to save the shire, sam. and it has been saved. but not for me. you don\\'t mean that. you can\\'t leave. the last pages are for you, sam. my dear sam: you cannot always be torn in two. you will have to be one and whole for many years. you have so much to enjoy and to be and to do. your part in the story will go on. well  i\\'m back.'"

       "' the world is changed. i feel it in the water. i feel it in the earth. i smell it in the air. much that once was  is lost. for none now live who remember it. it began with the forging of the great rings. three were given to the elves: immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. seven to the dwarf-lords: great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. and nine  nine rings were gifted to the race of men  who, above all else, desire power. for within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race. but they were all of them deceived. for another ring was made. in the land of mordor, in the fires of mount doom  the dark lord sauron forged in secret a master ring  to control all others. and into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice  and his will to dominate all life. one ring to rule them all. one by one  the free lands of middle-earth fell to the power of the ring. but there were some who resisted. a last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of mordor. and on the slopes of mount doom, they fought for the freedom of middle-earth. hold positions! fire the arrows! victory was near. but the power of the ring  could not be undone. it was in this moment  when all hope had faded  that isildur, son of the king, took up his father\\'s sword. sauron, the enemy of the free peoples of middle-earth, was defeated. the ring passed to isildur  who had this one chance to destroy evil forever. but the hearts of men  are easily corrupted. and the ring of power has a will of its own. it betrayed isildur  to his death. and some things that should not have been forgotten  were lost. history became legend  legend became myth. and for two and a half thousand years  the ring passed out of all knowledge. until, when chance came  it ensnared a new bearer. my precious. the ring came to the creature gollum  who took it deep into the tunnels of the misty mountains. and there it consumed him. it came to me. my own. my love. my own. my precious. the ring brought to gollum unnatural long life. for 500 years it poisoned his mind. and in the gloom of gollum\\'s cave, it waited. darkness crept back into the forests of the world. rumor grew of a shadow in the east  whispers of a nameless fear. and the ring of power perceived  its time had now come. it abandoned gollum. but something happened then the ring did not intend. it was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable. what\\'s this? a hobbit. bilbo baggins of the shire. a ring. lost! my precious is lost! for the time will soon come  when hobbits will shape the fortunes of all. the 22nd day of september  in the year 1400  by shire-reckoning. bag end, bagshot row. hobbiton, westfarthing  the shire  middle-earth. the third age of this world. there and back again. a hobbit\\'s tale. by bilbo baggins. now  where to begin? ah, yes  “concerning  hobbits.” hobbits have been living and farming in the four farthings of the shire  for many hundreds of years  quite content to ignore and be ignored  by the world of the big folk. middle-earth being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count  hobbits must seem of little importance  being neither renowned as great warriors  nor counted among the very wise. frodo! someone at the door. in fact, it has been remarked by some  that hobbits\\' only real passion is for food. a rather unfair observation  as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales  and the smoking of pipe-weed. but where our hearts truly lie  is in peace and quiet  and good, tilled earth. for all hobbits share a love of things that grow. and yes, no doubt to others our ways seem quaint. but today of all days. it is brought home to me  it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life. frodo, the door! sticklebacks. where is that boy? frodo! down from the door where it began and i must follow if i can the road goes ever on and on down from the door where it began now far ahead the road has gone and i must follow if i can you\\'re late. a wizard is never late, frodo baggins. nor is he early. he arrives precisely when he means to. it\\'s wonderful to see you, gandalf! you didn\\'t think i\\'d miss your uncle bilbo\\'s birthday? so how is the old rascal? i hear it\\'s going to be a party of special magnificence. you know bilbo. he\\'s got the whole piece in an uproar. well, that should please him. half the shire\\'s been invited. and the rest of them are turning up anyway. and so life in the shire goes on  very much as it has this past age  ..full of its own comings and goings, with change coming slowly. if it comes at all. for things are made to endure in the shire  passing from one generation to the next. there\\'s always been a baggins living here under the hill  in bag end. and there always will be. to tell you the truth, bilbo\\'s been a bit odd lateiy. i mean, more than usual. he\\'s taken to locking himself in his study. he spends hours and hours poring over old maps when he thinks i\\'m not looking. where\\'s it gone? he\\'s up to something. all right, then. keep your secrets. what? but i know you have something to do with it. good gracious me. before you came along, we bagginses were very well thought of. indeed. never had any adventures or did anything unexpected. if you\\'re referring to the incident with the dragon. i was barely involved. all i did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door. whatever you did, you\\'ve been officially labeled a disturber of the peace. oh, really? gandalf! gandalf! fireworks, gandalf! gandalf! fireworks, gandalf! gandalf? i\\'m glad you\\'re back. so am i, dear boy. so am i. whoa, whoa. no, thank you! we don\\'t want any more visitors, well-wishers or distant relations! and what about very old friends? gandalf? bilbo baggins. my dear gandalf! good to see you. 111 years old! who would believe it? you haven\\'t aged a day. come on, come in! welcome, welcome. oh, here we are. tea or maybe something a littie stronger? i\\'ve got a few bottles of the old winyard left. 1296. very good year. almost as old as i am. it was laid down by my father. what say we open one, eh? just tea, thank you. i was expecting you sometime last week. not that it matters. you come and go as you please. always have and always will. you caught me a bit unprepared i\\'m afraid. we\\'ve only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle  there\\'s some cheese here. no, that won\\'t do. we\\'ve got raspberry jam, an apple tart  but not much for afters. oh, no, we\\'re all right. i\\'ve just found some sponge cake. i could make you some eggs if you\\'d li  just tea, thank you. oh, right. you don\\'t mind if i eat, do you? no, not at all. bilbo! bilbo baggins! i\\'m not at home! it\\'s the sackville-bagginses. i know you\\'re in there! they\\'re after the house. they\\'ve never forgiven me for living this long. i\\'ve got to get away from these confounded relatives, hanging on the bell all day  never giving me a moment\\'s peace. i want to see mountains again. mountains, gandalf! and then find somewhere quiet where i can finish my book. oh, tea. so you mean to go through with your plan? yes, yes. it\\'s all in hand. all the arrangements are made. oh, thank you. frodo suspects something. of course he does. he\\'s a baggins  not some blockheaded bracegirdle from hardbottle. you will tell him, won\\'t you? yes, yes. he\\'s very fond of you. i know. he\\'d probably come with me if i asked him. i think in his heart, frodo\\'s still in love with the shire. the woods, the fields. little rivers. i am old, gandalf. i know i don\\'t look it, but i\\'m beginning to feel it in my heart. i feel thin. sort of stretched  like butter scraped over too much bread. i need a holiday. a very long holiday. and i don\\'t expect i shall return. in fact, i mean not to. old toby. the finest weed in the southfarthing. gandalf, my old friend  this will be a night to remember. hello, hello. fatty bolger. lovely to see you. welcome, welcome. go on, sam. ask rosie for a dance. i think i\\'ll just have another ale. oh, no, you don\\'t. go on! so there i was  at the mercy of three monstrous trolls. and they were all arguing amongst themselves  about how they were going to cook us. whether it be turned on a spit, or whether they should sit on us one by one, squash us into jelly. they spent so much time arguing the whithertos and the whyfors  that the sun\\'s first light crept over the top of the trees  and turned them all to stone! quickly. whoa up they go! no no, the big one — big one mrs. bracegirdle, how nice to see you. welcome, welcome. are all these children yours? good gracious, you have been productive. bilbo? sackville-bagginses! quickly, hide! thank you, my boy. you\\'re a good lad, frodo. i\\'m very selfish, you know. yes, i am. very selfish. i don\\'t know why i took you in after your mother and father died  but it wasn\\'t out of charity. i think it was because  of all my numerous relations  you were the one baggins that showed real spirit. bilbo, have you been at the gaffer\\'s home brew? no. well, yes, but that\\'s not the point. the point is, frodo  you\\'ll be all right. done! you\\'re supposed to stick it in the ground. it is in the ground. outside! this was your idea. bilbo. bilbo, watch out for the dragon! nonsense. there hasn\\'t been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years. that was good. let\\'s get another one. meriadoc brandybuck and peregrin took. i might\\'ve known. speech, bilbo! speech! speech! my dear bagginses and boffins  tooks and brandybucks  grubbs, chubbs  hornblowers  bolgers  bracegirdles  and proudfoots. proudfeet! today is my 111th birthday! happy birthday! but alas, eleventh-one years is far too short a time to live among  such excellent and admirable hobbits. i don\\'t know half of you half as well as i should like  and i like less than half of you half as well as you deserve. i, uh - i have things to do. i\\'ve put this off for far too long. i regret to announce this is the end! i\\'m going now. i bid you all a very fond farewell. goodbye. i suppose you think that was terribly clever. come on, gandalf. did you see their faces? there are many magic rings in this world, bilbo baggins  and none of them should be used lightly. it was just a bit of fun. oh, you\\'re probably right, as usual. you will keep an eye on frodo, won\\'t you? two eyes. as often as i can spare them. i\\'m leaving everything to him. what about this ring of yours? is that staying too? yes, yes. it\\'s in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece. no. wait, it is  here in my pocket. isn\\'t that--? isn\\'t that odd, now? yet, after all, why not? why shouldn\\'t i keep it? i think you should leave the ring behind, bilbo. is that so hard? well, no. and yes. now it comes to it, i don\\'t feel l ike parting with it. it\\'s mine. i found it! it came to me! there\\'s no need to get angry. well, if i\\'m angry, it\\'s your fault! it\\'s mine. my own. my precious. precious? it\\'s been called that before, but not by you. what business is it of yours what i do with my own things? i think you\\'ve had that ring quite long enough. you want it for yourself! bilbo baggins! do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks. i am not trying to rob you. i\\'m trying to help you. all your long years, we\\'ve been friends. trust me as you once did. let it go. you\\'re right, gandalf. the ring must go to frodo. it\\'s late. the road is long. yes, it is time. bilbo. hm? the ring is still in your pocket. ah. yes. i\\'ve thought up an ending for my book: “and he lived happily ever after to the end of his days.” and i\\'m sure you will, my dear friend. goodbye, gandalf. goodbye, dear bilbo. the road goes ever on and on  until our next meeting. it\\'s mine. my own. my precious. riddles in the dark. bilbo! bilbo! my precious. precious. he\\'s gone, hasn\\'t he? he talked for so long about leaving  i didn\\'t think he\\'d really do it. gandalf? bilbo\\'s ring. he\\'s gone to stay with the elves. he\\'s left you bag end. along with all his possessions. the ring is yours now. put it somewhere out of sight. where are you going? there are some things that i must see to. what things? questions. questions that need answering. you\\'ve only just arrived. i don\\'t understand. neither do i. keep it secret. keep it safe. shire! baggins! “the year 3434 of the second age. here follows the account of isildur, high king of gondor  and the finding of the ring of power.” “it has come to me. the one ring. it shall be an heirloom of my kingdom. all those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate  for i will risk no hurt to the ring. it is precious to me  though i buy it with great pain. the markings upon the band begin to fade. the writing, which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared. a secret now that only fire can tell.” shire  baggins. there\\'s no bagginses around here. they\\'re all up in hobbiton. that way. “hey ho to the dock i go to heal my heart and drown my woe rain may fall and wind may blow but there still be  many miles to go sweet is the sound of the pouring rain and the stream that falls from hill to plain better than rain or rippling brook is a mug of beer inside this took!” there\\'s been some strange folk crossing the shire. dwarves and others of a less than savory nature. war is brewing. the mountains are fair teeming with goblins. far-off tales and children\\'s stories, that\\'s all that is. you\\'re beginning to sound like that old bilbo baggins. cracked, he was. young mr. frodo here, he\\'s cracking. and proud of it. cheers, gaffer. aye. cheers. well it\\'s none of our concern what goes on beyond our borders. keep your nose out of trouble, and no trouble\\'ll come to you. good night, lads. good night. good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale. mind who you\\'re sweet-taking. don\\'t worry, sam. rosie knows an idiot when she sees one. does she? good night, sam. good night, mr. frodo. is it secret? is it safe? what are you doing? hold out your hand, frodo. it\\'s quite cool. what can you see? can you see anything? nothing. there\\'s nothing. wait. there are markings. it\\'s some form of elvish. i can\\'t read it. there are few who can. the language is that of mordor, which i will not utter here. mordor! in the common tongue, it says: “one ring to rule them all  one ring to find them  one ring to bring them all  and in the darkness bind them.” this is the one ring  forged by the dark lord sauron in the fires of mount doom. taken by isiidur from the hand of sauron himself. bilbo found it. in gollum\\'s cave. yes. for 60 years, the ring lay quiet in bilbo\\'s keeping  prolonging his life, delaying old age. but no longer, frodo. evil is stirring in mordor. the ring has awoken. it\\'s heard its master\\'s call. but he was destroyed. sauron was destroyed. no, frodo. the spirit of sauron endured. his life force is bound to the ring, and the ring survived. sauron has returned. his orcs have multiplied. his fortress at barad-dã»r is rebuilt in the land of mordor. sauron needs only this ring to cover all the lands in a second darkness. he is seeking it. seeking it — all his thought is bent on it. for the ring yearns above all else  to return to the hand of its master. they are one  the ring and the dark lord. frodo  he must never find it. all right. we put it away. we keep it hidden. we never speak of it again. no one knows it\\'s here, do they? do they, gandalf? there is one other who knew that bilbo had the ring. i looked everywhere for the creature gollum. but the enemy found him first. i don\\'t know how long they tortured him. but amidst the endless screams and inane babble, they discerned two words: shire! baggins! shire. baggins. but that would lead them here! who goes there? take it, gandalf! take it! no, frodo. you must take it! you cannot offer me this ring! i\\'m giving it to you! don\\'t tempt me, frodo! i dare not take it. not even to keep it safe. understand, frodo  i would use this ring from a desire to do good. but through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine. but it cannot stay in the shire! no no, it can\\'t. what must i do? you must leave. and leave quickly. where? where do i go? get out of the shire. make for the village of bree. bree. what about you? i\\'ll be waiting for you  at the inn of the prancing pony. and the ring will be safe there? i don\\'t know, frodo. i don\\'t have any answers. i must see the head of my order. he is both wise and powerful. trust me, frodo. he\\'ll know what to do. you\\'ll have to leave the name of baggins behind you. that name is not safe outside the shire. travel only by day. and stay off the road. i can cut across country easily enough. my dear frodo. hobbits really are amazing creatures. you can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month. and yet, after a hundred years  they can still surprise you. get down. confound it all, samwise gamgee! have you been eavesdropping? i haven\\'t been dropping no eaves. honest. i was just cutting the grass under the window there if you follow me. a little late for trimming the verge, don\\'t you think? i heard raisedices. what did you hear? speak! nothing important. that is, i heard a good deal about a ring, and a dark lord  and something about the end of the world but  please, mr. gandalf, sir, don\\'t hurt me. don\\'t turn me into anything unnatural. no? perhaps not. i\\'ve thought of a better use for you. come along, samwise. keep up. be careful, both of you. the enemy has many spies in his service: birds, beasts. is it safe? never put it on  for the agents of the dark lord will be drawn to its power. always remember, frodo  the ring is trying to get back to its master. it wants to be found. this is it. this is what? if i take one more step  it\\'ll be the farthest away from home i\\'ve ever been. come on, sam. remember what bilbo used to say: “it\\'s a dangerous business, frodo.” “going out your door. you step onto the road, and if you don\\'t keep your feet  there\\'s no knowing where you might be swept off to.” sam. wood-elves. they\\'re going to the harbor beyond the white towers. to the grey havens. they\\'re leaving middle-earth. never to return. i don\\'t know why  it makes me sad. everywhere i lie there\\'s a dirty great root sticking into my back. just shut your eyes  and imagine you\\'re back in your own bed  with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow. it\\'s not working, mr. frodo. i\\'m never going to be able to sleep out here. me neither, sam. smoke rises from the mountain of doom. the hour grows late. and gandalf the grey rides to isengard  seeking my counsel. for that is why you have come, is it not? my old friend. saruman. you are sure of this? beyond any doubt. so the ring of power has been found. all these long years, it was in the shire. under my very nose. yet you did not have the wit to see it. your love of the halfling\\'s leaf has clearly slowed your mind. but we still have time. time enough to counter sauron if we act quickly. time? what time do you think we have? sauron has regained much of his former strength. he cannot yet take physical form  but his spirit has lost none of its potency. concealed within his fortress, the lord of mordor sees all. his gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh. you know of what i speak, gandalf. a great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame. the eye of sauron. he is gathering all evil to him. very soon, he\\'ll have summoned an army  great enough for an assault upon middle-earth. you know this? how? i have seen it. a palantir is a dangerous tool, saruman. why? why should we fear to use it? they are not all accounted for, the lost seeing-stones. we do not know who else may be watching. the hour is later than you think. sauron\\'s forces are already moving. the nine have left minas morgul. the nine? they crossed the river isen on midsummer\\'s eve  disguised as riders in black. they\\'ve reached the shire? they will find the ring. and kill the one who carries it. frodo! you did not seriously think that a hobbit could contend with the will of sauron? there are none who can. against the power of mordor  there can be no victory. we must join with him, gandalf. we must join with sauron. it would be wise, my friend. tell me  friend  when did saruman the wise abandon reason for madness? i gave you the chance of  aiding me willingly  but you have elected the way of pain! mr. frodo? frodo? frodo! i thought i\\'d lost you. what are you taking about? it\\'s just something gandalf said. what did he say? “don\\'t you lose him, samwise gamgee.” and i don\\'t mean to. sam, we\\'re still in the shire. what could possibly happen? frodo. merry, it\\'s frodo baggins. hello, frodo. get off him. come on, frodo. what\\'s the meaning of this? you\\'ve been into farmer maggot\\'s crop! you get back here! get out of my field! you\\'ll know the devil if i catch up with you! i don\\'t know why he\\'s so upset. it\\'s only a couple of carrots. and some cabbages. and those three bags of potatoes that we lifted last week. and then the mushrooms the week before. yes, pippin. my point is  he\\'s clearly overreacting. run! oh, that was close. i think i\\'ve broken something. trust a brandybuck and a took! what? that was just a detour. a short cut. short cut to what? mushrooms! that\\'s mine. that\\'s nice, merry. here\\'s a nice one, sam. i think we should get off the road. get off the road! quick! be quiet! what was that? anything? nothing. what is going on? that black rider was looking for something. or someone. frodo? get down! i have to leave the shire. sam and i must get to bree. right. bucklebury ferry. follow me. run! this way! follow me! run! get the rope, sam! frodo! run, frodo! go! hurry! frodo, come on! come on! faster! jump! how far to the nearest crossing? the brandywine bridge. 20 miles. come on. what do you want? we\\'re heading for the prancing pony. hobbits. four hobbits! what\\'s more, out of the shire by your talk. what business brings you to bree? we wish to stay at the inn. our business is our own. all right young sir, i meant no offense. it\\'s my job to ask questions after nightfall. there\\'s talk of strange folk abroad. can\\'t be too careful. out of the way! watch where you\\'re walking. excuse me. good evening, little masters. what can i do for you? if you\\'re looking for accommodation, we got some nice cozy hobbit-sized rooms available. always proud to cater to little folk, mister ? underhill. my name\\'s underhill. underhill, yeah. we\\'re friends of gandalf the grey. can you tell him we\\'ve arrived? gandalf? gandalf. oh, yes  i remember. elderly chap. big grey beard, pointy hat. not seen him for six months. what do we do now? sam  he\\'ll be here. he\\'ll come. get out of my way! what\\'s that? this, my friend, is a pint. it comes in pints? i\\'m getting one. you got a whole half already! that fellow\\'s done nothing but stare at you since we arrived. excuse me. that man in the corner. who is he? he\\'s one of them rangers. they\\'re dangerous folk they are, wandering the wilds. what his right name is, i\\'ve never heard, but \\'round here he\\'s known as strider. strider. baggins  baggins  baggins  baggins  baggins  baggins? sure, i know a baggins. he\\'s over there. frodo baggins. he\\'s my second cousin, once removed on his mother\\'s side  and my third cousin, twice removed  pippin! steady on, frodo. you cannot hide. i see you. there is no life  in theid. only  death. you draw far too much attention to yourself, “mr. underhill.” what do you want? a little more caution from you. that is no trinket you carry. i carry nothing. indeed. i can avoid being seen if i wish  but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift. who are you? are you frightened? yes. not nearly frightened enough. i know what hunts you. let him go! or i\\'ll have you, longshanks. you have a stout heart, little hobbit. but that will not save you. you can no longer wait for the wizard, frodo. they\\'re coming. what are they? they were once men. great kings of men. then sauron the deceiver gave to them nine rings of power. blinded by their greed, they took them without question. one by one, falling into darkness. now they are slaves to his will. they are the nazgã»l. ringwraiths. neither living nor dead. at all times they feel  the presence of the ring  drawn to the power of the one. they will never stop hunting you. where are you taking us? into the wild. how can we know this strider is a friend of gandalf? i think a servant of the enemy would look fairer  and feel fouler. he\\'s foul enough. we have no choice but to trust him. but where is he leading us? to rivendell, master gamgee. to the house of elrond. did you hear that? rivendell. we\\'re going to see the elves. gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall. what about breakfast? you\\'ve already had it. we\\'ve had one, yes. what about second breakfast? don\\'t think he knows about second breakfast, pip. what about elevenses? luncheon? afternoon tea? dinner? supper? he knows about them, doesn\\'t he? i wouldn\\'t count on it. pippin! what do they eat when they can\\'t get hobbit? tinúviel the elven-fair. immortal maiden elven-wise. about him cast her night-dark hair. and arms like silver glimmering. who is she? this woman you sing of. \\'tis the lay of luthien. the elf-maiden who gave her love to beren, a mortal. what happened to her? she died. get some sleep, frodo. the power of isengard is at your command  sauron, lord of the earth. build me an army worthy of mordor. what orders from mordor, my lord? what does the eye command? we have work to do. the trees are strong, my lord. their roots go deep. rip them all down. this was the great watchtower of amon sûl. we shall rest here tonight. these are for you. keep them close. i\\'m going to have a look around. stay here. my tomato\\'s burst. could i have some bacon? want a tomato, sam? what are you doing?! tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon. we saved some for you, mr. frodo. put it out, you fools! put it out! that\\'s nice! ash on my tomatoes! go! back, you devils! theid-in only death frodo! oh, sam. strider! help him, strider. he\\'s been stabbed by a morgul blade. this is beyond my skill to heal. he needs elvish medicine. hurry! we\\'re six days from rivendell! he\\'ll never make it! hold on, frodo. gandalf! look, frodo. it\\'s mr. bilbo\\'s trolls. mr. frodo? he\\'s going cold. is he going to die? he\\'s passing into the shadow world. he\\'ll soon become a wraith like them. they\\'re close. sam, do you know the athelas plant? athelas? kingsfoil. kingsfoil, aye, it\\'s a weed. it may help to slow the poisoning. hurry! what\\'s this, a ranger caught off his guard? frodo. i am arwen — i\\'ve come to help you. hear myice, come back to the light. who is she? frodo. she\\'s an elf. he\\'s fading. he\\'s not going to last. we must get him to my father. i\\'ve been looking for you for two days. where are you taking him? there are five wraiths behind you. where the other four are, i do not know. stay with the hobbits, i\\'ll send horses for you. i will take him. i am the swifter rider. the road is very dangerous. what are they saying? frodo dies. if i get across the river  the power of my people will protect him. i do not fear them. as you wish. arwen  ride hard. don\\'t look back. ride fast, asfaloth. ride fast! what are you doing?! those wraiths are still out there! ride fast, asfaloth! give up the halfling, she-elf. if you want him, come and claim him. waters of the misty mountains  listen to the great word; flow waters of loudwater against the ringwraiths. waters of the misty mountains  listen to the great word; flow waters of loudwater against the ringwraiths! no. no! frodo, no. frodo, don\\'t give in. not now. what grace is given me  let it pass to him. let him be spared. save him. hear myice come back to the light. where am i? you are in the house of elrond. and it is 10 o\\'clock in the morning on october 24th, if you want to know. gandalf! yes, i\\'m here. and you\\'re lucky to be here too. a few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid. but you have some strength in you, my dear hobbit. what happened, gandalf? why didn\\'t you meet us? i am sorry, frodo. i was delayed. a friendship with saruman is not lightly thrown aside. one ill turn deserves another. it is over. embrace the power of the ring  or embrace your own destruction! there is only one lord of the ring. only one who can bend it to his will. and he does not share power. so you have chosen death. gandalf? what is it? nothing, frodo. frodo! sam. bless you, you\\'re awake! sam has hardly left your side. we were that worried about you. weren\\'t we, mr. gandalf? by the skills of lord elrond, you\\'re beginning to mend. welcome to rivendell, frodo baggins. bilbo! hello, frodo, my lad. bilbo. there and back again a hobbit\\'s tale, by bilbo baggins.\\'\\' this is wonderful. i meant to go back  wonder at the powers of mirkwood  visit lake-town  see the lonely mountain again. but age, it seems, has finally caught up with me. i miss the shire. i spent all my childhood pretending i was off somewhere else. off with you, on one of your adventures. but my own adventure turned out to be quite different. i\\'m not like you, bilbo. my dear boy. now, what have i forgotten? packed already? no harm in being prepared. i thought you wanted to see the elves. i do. more than anything. i did. it\\'s just  we did what gandalf wanted, didn\\'t we? we got the ring this far, to rivendell. and i thought  seeing as how you\\'re on the mend, we\\'d be off soon. off home. you are right, sam. we did what we set out to do. the ring will be safe in rivendell. i am ready to go home. his strength returns. that wound will never fully heal. he will carry it the rest of his life. and yet to have come so far still bearing the ring  the hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil. it is a burden he should never have had to bear. we can ask no more of frodo. gandalf, the enemy is moving. sauron\\'s forces are massing in the east. his eye is fixed on rivendell. and saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us. our list of allies grows thin. his treachery runs deeper than you know. by foul craft, saruman has crossed orcs with goblin-men. he\\'s breeding an army in the caverns of isengard. an army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed. saruman is coming for the ring. this evil cannot be concealed by the power of the elves. we do not have the strength to fight both mordor and isengard! gandalf  the ring cannot stay here. this peril belongs to all middle-earth. they must decide now how to end it. the time of the elves is over. my people are leaving these shores. who will you look to when we\\'ve gone? the dwarves? they hide in mountains seeking riches. they care not for the troubles of others. it is in men that we must place our hope. men? men are weak. the race of men is failing. the blood of numenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity forgotten. it is because of men the ring survives. i was there, gandalf. i was there 3000 years ago  when isildur took the ring. i was there the day the strength of men failed. isildur, hurry! follow me. i led isildur into the heart of mount doom  where the ring was forged, the one place it could be destroyed. cast it into the fire! destroy it! no. isildur! it should have ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure. isildur kept the ring. the line of kings is broken. there\\'s no strength left in the world of men. they\\'re scattered, divided, leaderless. there is one who could unite them. one who could reclaim the throne of gondor. he turned from that path a long time ago. he has chosen exile. you are no elf. men of the south are welcome here. who are you? i am a friend to gandalf the grey. then we are here on common purpose  friend. the shards of narsil. the blade that cut the ring from sauron\\'s hand. it\\'s still sharp. but no more than a broken heirloom. why do you fear the past? you are isildur\\'s heir, not isildur himseif. you are not bound to his fate. the same blood flows in my veins. the same weakness. your time will come. you will face the same evil. and you will defeat it. till now the shadow not masters, aragorn not over you, not over me. do you remember when we first met? i thought i had strayed into a dream. long years have passed. you did not wear the troubles you carry now. do you remember what i told you? you said you\\'d bind yourself to me  forsaking the immortal life of your people. and to that i hold. i would rather share one lifetime with you  than face all the ages of this world alone. i choose a mortal life. you cannot give me this. it is mine to give to whom i will  like my heart. strangers from distant lands, friends of old  you\\'ve been summoned here to answer the threat of mordor. middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction. none can escape it. you will unite, or you will fall. each race is bound to this fate, this one doom. bring forth the ring, frodo. so it is true. the ring of power  the doom of men  in a dream  i saw the eastern sky grow dark  but in the west a pale light lingered. aice was crying: “your doom is near at hand. isildur\\'s bane is found.” in your blood isildur\\'s bane. boromir! “one ring to rule them all  one ring to find them  one ring to bring them all  and in the darkness bind them.” never before has anyice uttered the words of that tongue here in imladris. i do not ask your pardon, master elrond  for the black speech of mordor  may yet be heard  in every corner of the west! the ring is altogether evil. it is a gift. a gift to the foes of mordor. why not use this ring? long has my father, the steward of gondor  kept the forces of mordor at bay. by the blood of our people  are your lands kept safe. give gondor the weapon of the enemy. let us use it against him. you cannot wield it. none of us can. the one ring answers to sauron alone. it has no other master. and what would a ranger know of this matter? this is no mere ranger. he is aragorn, son of arathorn. you owe him your allegiance. aragorn. this is isildur\\'s heir? and heir to the throne of gondor. sit down, legolas. gondor has no king. gondor needs no king. aragorn is right. we cannot use it. you have only one choice. the ring must be destroyed. then what are we waiting for? in the land of mordor where the shadows lie the ring cannot be destroyed, gimli, son of gloin  by any craft that we here possess. the ring was made in the fires of mount doom. one ring to rule them all  only there can it be unmade. it must be taken deep into mordor  and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came. one ring to find them  one of you  must do this. one does not simply walk into mordor. its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs. there is evil there that does not sleep. the great eye is ever-watchful. it is a barren wasteland  riddled with fire, and ash and dust. the very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. not with 10,000 men could you do this. it is folly. have you heard nothing lord elrond has said? the ring must be destroyed. and i suppose you think you are the one to do it! and if we fail, what then? what happens when sauron takes back what is his? i will be dead before i see the ring in the hands of an elf! never trust an elf! do you not understand? while you bicker amongst yourselves, sauron\\'s power grows! none can escape it! you\\'ll all be destroyed! one ring to rule them all  one ring to find them  one ring to rule them all  one ring to find them  one ring to rule them all  one ring to find them  one ring to rule them all  i will take it. i will take it. i will take the ring to mordor. though  i do not know the way. i will help you bear this burden, frodo baggins  as long as it is yours to bear. if by my life or death i can protect you  i will. you have my sword. and you have my bow. and my ax. you carry the fates of us all, little one. if this is indeed the will of the council  then gondor will see it done. mr. frodo\\'s not going anywhere without me. no indeed it is hardly possible to separate you  even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not. oy. we\\'re coming too! you\\'ll have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us. anyway, you need people of intelligence on this sort of  mission. quest. thing. well, that rules you out, pip. nine companions. so be it. you shall be: the fellowship of the ring. great! where are we going? she wanted to protect her child. she thought in rivendell you would be safe. in her heart, your mother knew you\\'d be hunted all your life. that you\\'d never escape your fate. the skill of the elves can reforge the sword of kings  but only you have the power to wield it. i do not want that power. i have never wanted it. you are the last of that bloodline. there is no other. my old sword! sting. here, take it. take it. it\\'s so light. yes, yeah. made by the elves, you know. the blade glows blue when orcs are close. and it\\'s times like that, my lad, when you have to be extra careful. here\\'s a pretty thing. mithril. as light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales. let me see you put it on. come on. my old ring. i should very much like  to hold it again, one last time. i\\'m sorry i brought this upon you, my boy. i\\'m sorry that you must carry this burden. i\\'m sorry for everything. the ring-bearer is setting out on the quest of mount doom. on you who travel with him, no oath  nor bond is laid to go further than you will. farewell. hold to your purpose. may the blessings of elves and men  and all free folk go with you. the fellowship awaits the ring-bearer. mordor, gandalf, is it left or right? left. we must hold to this course, west of the misty mountains, for 40 days. if our luck holds, the gap of rohan will still be open to us. from there, our road turns east to mordor. two, one, five. good! very good. move your feet. you look good, pippin. thanks. faster! if anyone was to ask for my opinion, which i note they\\'re not  i\\'d say we were taking the long way \\'round. gandalf. we could pass through the mines of moria. my cousin balin would give us a royal welcome. no gimli, i would not take the road through moria unless i had no other choice. sorry! get him! for the shire! hold him. hold him down, merry! gentlemen, that\\'s enough. you\\'ve got my arm! you\\'ve got my arm! what is that? nothing. it\\'s just a wisp of cloud. it\\'s moving fast. against the wind. crebain from dunland! hide! merry! take cover! spies of saruman. the passage south is being watched. we must take the pass of caradhras. frodo! boromir. it is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt  over so small a thing. such a little thing. boromir! give the ring to frodo. as you wish. i care not. so, gandalf, you try to lead them over caradhras. and if that fails, where then will you go? if the mountain defeats you  will you risk a more dangerous road? wake up cruel redhorn! there is a fellice on the air. may your horn be bloodstained! it\\'s saruman! he\\'s trying to bring down the mountain! gandalf, we must turn back! no! sleep caradhras, be still, lie still, hold your wrath! wake up cruel redhorn! may your bloodstained horn  fall upon the enemy-heads! we must get off the mountain! make for the gap of rohan, and take the west road to my city! the gap of rohan takes us too close to isengard! we cannot pass over a mountain. let us go under it. let us go through the mines of moria. moria. you fear to go into those mines. the dwarves delved too greedily and too deep. you know what they awoke in the darkness of khazad-dûm: shadow and flame. let the ring-bearer decide. we cannot stay here! this will be the death of the hobbits. frodo? we will go through the mines. so be it. frodo, come and help an old man. how is your shoulder? better than it was. and the ring? you feel its power growing, don\\'t you? i\\'ve felt it too. you must be careful now. evil will be drawn to you from outside the fellowship. and, i fear, from within. who then do i trust? you must trust yourself. trust your own strengths. what do you mean? there are many powers in this world  for good or for evil. some are greater than i am. and against some i have not yet been tested. the walls  of moria. dwarf doors are invisible when closed. yes, gimli, their own masters cannot find them if their secrets are forgotten. why doesn\\'t that surprise me? well, let\\'s see. “moon-star” it mirrors only starlight and moonlight. it reads; “the doors of durin, lord of moria. speak, friend, and enter.” what do you suppose that means? oh it\\'s quite simple. if you are a friend, you speak the password and the doors will open. gate of the elves, open now for me! doorway of the dwarf-folk  listen to the word of my tongue. nothing\\'s happening. i once knew every spell in all the tongues of elves  men and orcs. what are you going to do, then? knock your head against these doors, peregrin took! and if that does not shatter them  and i am allowed a little peace from foolish questions  i will try to find the opening words. gate of elves  listen to my word  threshold of dwarves! mines are no place for a pony. even one so brave as bill. bye-bye, bill. doorway of the dwarf-folk  go on, bill. go on. don\\'t worry, sam, he knows the way home. do not disturb the water. oh, it\\'s useless. it\\'s a riddle. “speak \\'friend\\' and enter.” what\\'s the elvish word for “friend”? mellon. soon, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the dwarves. roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone! this, my friend, is the home of my cousin balin. and they call it a mine. a mine! this is no mine. it\\'s a tomb. no  no! goblins. we make for the gap of rohan. we should never have come here. now, get out of here. get out! frodo! help! strider! help! get off him! aragorn! frodo! into the mines! legolas! into the cave! run! we now have but one choice. we must face the long dark of moria. be on your guard. there are older and fouler things than orcs  in the deep places of the world. quietly now. it\\'s a four-day journey to the other side. let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed. the wealth of moria was not in gold  or jewels  but mithril. bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that thorin gave him. oh, that was a kingly gift. yes. i never told him  but its worth was greater than the value of the shire. pippin. i have no memory of this place. are we lost? no. i think we are. gandalf\\'s thinking. merry? what? i\\'m hungry. there\\'s something down there. it\\'s gollum. gollum? he\\'s been following us for three days. he escaped the dungeons of barad-dûr? escaped  or was set loose. now the ring has brought him here. he will never be rid of his need for it. he hates and loves the ring, as he hates and loves himseif. smeagol\\'s life is a sad story. yes, smeagol he was once called. before the ring found him. before it drove him mad. it\\'s a pity bilbo didn\\'t kill him when he had the chance. pity? it is pity that stayed bilbo\\'s hand. many that live deserve death. some that die deserve life. can you give it to them, frodo? do not be too eager to deal out death and judgment. even the very wise cannot see all ends. my heart tells me that gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill  before this is over. the pity of bilbo may rule the fate of many. i wish the ring had never come to me. i wish none of this had happened. so do all who live to see such times. but that is not for them to decide. all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. there are other forces at work in this world, frodo, besides the will of evil. bilbo was meant to find the ring. in which case, you also were meant to have it. and that is an encouraging thought. it\\'s that way. he\\'s remembered. no. but the air doesn\\'t smell so foul down here. if in doubt, meriadoc, always follow your nose. let me risk a little more light. behold  the great realm and dwarf-city of dwarrowdelf. now there\\'s an eye opener, and no mistake. gimli! no! oh, no. no. “here lies balin  son of fundin  lord of moria.” he is dead, then. it\\'s as i feared. we must move on. we cannot linger. “they have taken the bridge and the second hall. we have barred the gates  but cannot hold them for long. the ground shakes. drums  drums in the deep. we cannot get out. a shadow moves in the dark. we cannot get out. they are coming.” fool of a took! throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity. frodo! orcs. get back! stay close to gandalf! they have a cave-troll. let them come! there is one dwarf yet in moria who still draws breath. i think i\\'m getting the hang of this. frodo! aragorn! aragorn! frodo! frodo! oh, no. he\\'s alive. i\\'m all right. i\\'m not hurt. you should be dead. that spear would have skewered a wild boar. i think there\\'s more to this hobbit than meets the eye. mithril. you are full of surprises, master baggins. to the bridge of khazad-dûm! this way! what is this new devilry? a balrog. a demon of the ancient world. this foe is beyond any of you. run! quickly! gandalf. lead them on, aragorn. the bridge is near. do as i say! swords are no more use here. gandalf! merry! pippin! sam! nobody tosses a dwarf. not the beard! steady. hold on! hang on! lean forward! steady. come on! now! over the bridge! fly! you cannot pass! gandalf! i am a servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of anor. the dark fire will not avail you, flame of udûn! go back to the shadow. you — shall not — pass! no! no! gandalf! fly, you fools! no! aragorn! legolas, get them up. give them a moment, for pity\\'s sake! by nightfall, these hills will be swarming with orcs. we must reach the woods of lothlórien. come, boromir. legolas. gimli, get them up. on your feet, sam. frodo? frodo! stay close, young hobbits! they say that a great sorceress lives in these woods. an elf-witch  of terrible power. all who look upon her  fall under her spell. frodo! and are never seen again. your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom. you bring great evil here, ring-bearer. mr. frodo? well, here\\'s one dwarf she won\\'t ensnare so easily. i have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox. the dwarf breathes so loud, we could have shot him in the dark. well met, legolas son of thranduil. our fellowship stands in your debt,… haldir of lórien. oh, aragorn of the dúnedain  you are known to us. haldir. so much for the legendary courtesy of the elves! speak words we can all understand! we have not had dealings with the dwarves since the dark days. and you know what this dwarf says to that? i spit upon your grave! that was not so courteous. you bring great evil with you. you can go no further. we need your protection. the road is very dangerous. merin le telim. i wish we may come with you. please, understand. we need your support! aragorn! i wish we may come with you. the road is very dangerous. gandalf\\'s death was not in vain. nor would he have you give up hope. you carry a heavy burden, frodo. don\\'t carry the weight of the dead. you will follow me. caras galadhon. the heart of elvendom on earth. realm of the lord celeborn and of galadriel, lady of light. the enemy knows you have entered here. what hope you had in secrecy is now gone. eight there are here, yet nine there were set out from rivendell. tell me, where is gandalf? for i much desire to speak with him. i can no longer see him from afar. gandalf the grey did not pass the borders of this land. he has fallen into shadow. he was taken by both shadow and flame. a balrog of morgoth. for we went needlessly into the net of moria. needless were none of the deeds of gandalf in life. we do not yet know his full purpose. do not let the great emptiness of khazad-dûm fill your heart  gimli, son of gloin. for the world has grown full of peril  and in all lands  love is now mingled with grief. what now becomes of this fellowship? without gandalf, hope is lost. the quest stands upon the edge of a knife. stray but a little and it will fail  to the ruin of all. yet hope remains while the company is true. do not let your hearts be troubled. go now and rest  for you are weary with sorrow and much toil. tonight, you will sleep  welcome, frodo of the shire  one who has seen the eye! a lament for gandalf. what do they say about him? i have not the heart to tell you. for me, the grief is still too near. i bet they don\\'t mention his fireworks. there should be a verse about them. the finest rockets ever seen they burst in stars of blue and green or after thunder, silver showers came falling like a rain of flowers oh, that doesn\\'t do them justice by a long road. take some rest. these borders are well-protected. i will find no rest here. i heard herice inside my head. she spoke of my father and the fall of gondor. she said to me; “even now there is hope left.” but i cannot see it. it is long since we had any hope. my father is a noble man. but his rule is failing  and our people lose faith. he looks to me to make things right, and i would do it. i would see the glory of gondor restored. have you ever seen it, aragorn? the white tower of ecthelion. glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver. its banners caught high in the morning breeze. have you ever been called home  by the clear ringing of silver trumpets? i have seen the white city  long ago. one day, our paths will lead us there. and the tower guard shall take up the call: “the lords of gondor have returned.” will you look into the mirror? what will i see? even the wisest cannot tell. for the mirror  shows many things. things that were  things that are  and some things  that have not yet come to pass. i know what it is you saw. for it is also in my mind. it is what will come to pass if you should fail. the fellowship is breaking. it is already begun. he will try to take the ring. you know of whom i speak. one by one, it will destroy them all. if you ask it of me  i will give you the one ring. you offer it to me freely. i do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this. in place of a dark lord, you would have a queen  not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn! treacherous as the sea! stronger than the foundations of the earth! all shall love me  and despair. i pass the test. i will diminish  and go into the west  and remain galadriel. i cannot do this alone. you are a ring-bearer, frodo. to bear a ring of power  is to be alone. this is nenya, the ring of adamant. and i am its keeper. this task was appointed to you. and if you do not find a way  no one will. then i know what i must do. it\\'s just  i\\'m afraid to do it. even the smallest person can change the course of the future. do you know how the orcs first came into being? they were elves once. taken by the dark powers  tortured and mutilated. a ruined and terrible form of life. and now  perfected. my fighting uruk-hai  whom do you serve? saruman! hunt them down. do not stop until, they are found. you do not know pain. you do not know fear. you will taste man-flesh! one of the halflings carries something of great value. bring them to me alive and unspoiled. kill the others. never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people. may these cloaks help shield you from unfriendly eyes. lembas. elvish waybread. one small bite is enough to fill the stomach of a grown man. how many did you eat? four. every league you travel south, the danger will increase. mordor orcs now hold the eastern shore of the anduin. nor will you find safety on the western bank. strange creatures bearing the mark of the white hand have been seen on our borders. seldom do orcs journey in the open under the sun, yet these have done so. you are being followed. by river you have the chance of outrunning the enemy to the falls of rauros. my gift for you, legolas, is a bow of the galadhrim. worthy of the skill of our woodland kin. these are the daggers of the noldorin. they have already seen service in war. do not fear, young peregrin took. you will find your courage. and for you, samwise gamgee  elven rope made of hithlain. thank you, my lady. have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers? and what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves? nothing. except to look upon the lady of the galadhrim one last time  for she is more fair than all the jewels beneath the earth. actually  there was one thing. no, no, i couidn\\'t. it\\'s quite impossible. stupid to ask. i have nothing greater to give  than the gift you already bear. for her love  the gift of life of arwen will dwindle. i wish that she endures, even if we separate  beyond the limits of this world. i wish that she sails to valinor. that choice is yet before her. you have your own choice to make, aragorn. to rise above the height of all your fathers since the days of elendil  or to fall into darkness with all that is left of your kin. farewell. there is much you have yet to do. we shall not meet again, elessar. farewell, frodo baggins. i give you the light of earendil  our most beloved star. may it be a light for you in dark places  when all other lights go out. i have taken my worst wound at this parting  having looked my last upon that which is fairest. henceforth i will call nothing fair unless it be her gift to me. what was her gift? i asked her for one hair from her golden head. she gave me three. gollum. he has tracked us since moria. i had hoped we would lose him on the river. but he\\'s too clever a waterman. and if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts  it will make the crossing even more dangerous. have some food, mr. frodo. no, sam. you haven\\'t eaten anything all day. you\\'re not sleeping, neither. don\\'t think i haven\\'t noticed. mr. frodo i\\'m all right. but you\\'re not. i\\'m here to help you. i promised gandalf that i would. you can\\'t help me, sam. not this time. get some sleep. minas tirith is the safer road. you know that. from there we can regroup. strike out for mordor from a place of strength. there is no strength in gondor that can avail us. you were quick enough to trust the elves. have you so little faith in your own people? yes, there is weakness. there is frailty. but there is courage also, and honor to be found in men. but you will not see that. you are afraid! all your life, you have hidden in the shadows. scared of who you are, of what you are. i will not lead the ring within a hundred leagues of your city. frodo. the argonath. long have i desired to look upon the kings of old. my kin. we cross the lake at nightfall. hide the boats and continue on foot. we approach mordor from the north. oh, yes? just a simple matter of finding our way through emyn muil  an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks. and after that, it gets even better. festering, stinking marshland as far as the eye can see. that is our road. i suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, master dwarf. recover my  we should leave now. no. orcs patrol the eastern shore. we must wait for cover of darkness. it is not the eastern shore that worries me. a shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind. something draws near. i can feel it. recover strength? pay no heed to that, young hobbit. where\\'s frodo? none of us should wander alone. you, least of all. so much depends on you. frodo? i know why you seek solitude. you suffer. i see it day by day. you sure you do not suffer needlessly? there are other ways, frodo. other paths that we might take. i know what you would say. it would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart. warning against what? we\\'re all afraid, frodo. but to let that fear drive us, to destroy what hope we have  don\\'t you see that is madness? there is no other way. i ask only for the strength to defend my people! if you would but lend me the ring. no. why do you recoil? i am no thief. you are not yourself. what chance do you think you have? they will find you. they will take the ring. and you will beg for death before the end! you fool! it is not yours, save by unhappy chance! it could have been mine. it should be mine! give it to me! give it to me! no! give it to me! no. i see your mind. you will take the ring to sauron! you will betray us! you\\'ll go to your death, and the death of us all! curse you! curse you and all the halflings! frodo? frodo. what have i done? please, frodo. frodo, i\\'m sorry! here inid, only death. frodo? it has taken boromir. where is the ring? stay away! frodo! i swore to protect you. can you protect me from yourself? would you destroy it? aragorn. aragorn. elessar. i would have gone with you to the end. into the very fires of mordor. i know. look after the others. especially sam. he will not understand. go, frodo! run. run! mr. frodo! find the halfling! find the halfling! elendil! aragorn, go! frodo! hide here. quick! come on! what\\'s he doing? he\\'s leaving. no! pippin! run, frodo. go! hey! hey, you! over here! hey! over here! this way! it\\'s working! i know it\\'s working! run! the horn of gondor. boromir. run! no. they took the little ones. hold still. frodo. where is frodo? i let frodo go. then you did what i could not. i tried to take the ring from him. the ring is beyond our reach now. forgive me. i did not see it. i have failed you all. no, boromir. you fought bravely. you have kept your honor. leave it. it is over. the world of men will fall and all will come to darkness  and my city to ruin. i do not know what strength is in my blood  but i swear to you, i will not let the white city fall  nor our people fail. our people. our people. i would have followed you, my brother. my captain. my king. be at peace  son of gondor. they will look for his coming from the white tower. but he will not return. frodo! i wish the ring had never come to me. i wish none of this had happened. so do all who live to see such times  but that is not for them to decide. all you have to decide  is what to do with the time that is given to you. frodo, no! frodo! mr. frodo! no, sam. go back, sam! i\\'m going to mordor alone. of course you are. and i\\'m coming with you! you can\\'t swim! sam! sam! i made a promise, mr. frodo. a promise: “don\\'t you leave him, samwise gamgee.” and i don\\'t mean to. i don\\'t mean to. oh sam. come on. hurry! frodo and sam have reached the eastern shore. you mean not to follow them. frodo\\'s fate is no longer in our hands. then it has all been in vain. the fellowship has failed. not if we hold true to each other. we will not abandon merry and pippin to torment and death. not while we have strength left. leave all that can be spared behind. we travel light. let us hunt some orc. yes! mordor. i hope the others find a safer road. strider will look after them. i don\\'t suppose we\\'ll ever see them again. we may yet, mr. frodo. we may. sam  i\\'m glad you\\'re with me. you cannot pass! gandalf! i am a servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of anor. go back to the shadow. the dark fire will not avail you, flame of udun! you shall not pass! no! no! gandalf! fly, you fools. no! gandalf! gandalf! what is it, mr. frodo? nothing. just a dream. can you see the bottom? no! don\\'t look down, sam! just keep going! catch it! grab it, mr. frodo! mr. frodo! i think i\\'ve found the bottom. bogs and rope, and goodness knows what. it\\'s not natural. none of it. what\\'s in this? nothing. just a bit of seasoning. i thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something. roast chicken?! you never know. sam. my dear sam. it\\'s very special, that. it\\'s the best salt in all the shire. it is special. it\\'s a little bit of home. we can\\'t leave this here for someone to follow us down. who\\'s gonna follow us down here, mr. frodo? it\\'s a shame, really. lady galadriel gave me that. real elvish rope. well, there\\'s nothing for it. it\\'s one of my knots. won\\'t come free in a hurry. real elvish rope. mordor. the one place in middle-earth we don\\'t want to see any closer. and it\\'s the one place we\\'re trying to get to. it\\'s just where we can\\'t get. let\\'s face it, mr. frodo, we\\'re lost. i don\\'t think gandalf meant for us to come this way. he didn\\'t mean for a lot of things to happen, sam  but they did. mr. frodo? it\\'s the ring, isn\\'t it? it\\'s getting heavier. what food have we got left? well, let me see. oh, yes. lovely. lembas bread. and look! more lembas bread. i don\\'t usually hold with foreign food  but this elvish stuff, it\\'s not bad. nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, sam? those rain clouds might. this looks strangely familiar. it\\'s because we\\'ve been here before. we\\'re going in circles. what is that horrid stink? i warrant there\\'s a nasty bog nearby. can you smell it? yes. i can smell it. we\\'re not alone. the thieves. the thieves. the filthy little thieves. where is it? where is it? they stole it from us. my precious. curse them, we hates them! it\\'s ours, it is, and we wants it! this is sting. you\\'ve seen it before  haven\\'t you, gollum? release him or i\\'ll cut your throat. it burns! it burns us! it freezes! nasty elves twisted it. take it off us! quiet, you! it\\'s hopeless. every orc in mordor\\'s going to hear this racket. let\\'s just tie him up and leave him. no! that would kill us! kill us! it\\'s no more than you deserve! maybe he does deserve to die. but now that i see him, i do pity him. we be nice to them if they be nice to us. take it off us. we swears to do what you wants. we swears. there\\'s no promise you can make that i can trust. we swears  to serve the master of the precious. we will swear on  on the precious. gollum. gollum. the ring is treacherous. it will hold you to your word. yes  on the precious. on the precious. i don\\'t believe you! get down! i said, down! sam! he\\'s trying to trick us. if we let him go, he\\'ll throttle us in our sleep. you know the way to mordor? yes. you\\'ve been there before? yes. you will lead us to the black gate. to the gate, to the gate! to the gate, the master says. yes! no! we won\\'t go back. not there. not to him. they can\\'t make us. gollum! gollum! but we swore to serve the master of the precious. no. ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits. and orcses, thousands of orcses. and always the great eye watching, watching. hey! come back now! come back! there! what did i tell you? he\\'s run off, the old villain. so much for his promises. this way, hobbits. follow me! merry! merry! you\\'re late. our master grows impatient. he wants the shire-rats now. i don\\'t take orders from orc-maggots. saruman will have his prize. we will deliver them. merry! merry? wake up. my friend is sick. he needs water. please! sick, is he? give him some medicine, boys! stop it! can\\'t take his draught! leave him alone! why? you want some? then keep your mouth shut. merry. hello, pip. you\\'re hurt. i\\'m fine. it was just an act. an act? see? i fooled you too. don\\'t worry about me, pip. what is it? what do you smell? man-flesh. they\\'ve picked up our trail. aragorn. let\\'s move! their pace has quickened. they must have caught our scent. hurry! come on, gimli! three days and nights pursuit. no food. no rest. and no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell. not idly do the leaves of lorien fall. they may yet be alive. less than a day ahead of us. come. come, gimli! we\\'re gaining on them! i\\'m wasted on cross-country. we dwarves are natural sprinters. very dangerous over short distances. rohan. home of the horse-lords. there\\'s something strange at work here. some evil gives speed to these creatures. sets its will against us. legolas! what do your elf-eyes see? the uruks turn northeast. they\\'re taking the hobbits to isengard. saruman. the world is changing. who now has the strength to stand against the armies of isengard  and mordor? to stand against the might of sauron and saruman  and the union of the two towers? together, my lord sauron  we shall rule this middle-earth. the old world will burn in the fires of industry. the forests will fall. a new order will rise. we will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear  and the iron fists of the orc. i want them armed and ready to march within two weeks! but, my lord, there are too many! they cannot all be armed in time, we don\\'t have the means. build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day. we don\\'t have enough fuel to feed the fires. the forest of fangorn lies on our doorstep. burn it. yes. we will fight for you. swear it. we will die for saruman. the horse-men took your lands. they drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks. murderers! take back the lands they stole from you. burn every village! we have only to remove those who oppose us. it will begin in rohan. too long have these peasants stood against you. but no more. eothain! eothain! you take your sister. you\\'ll go faster with just two. papa says eothain must not ride garulf. he is too big for him. listen to me. you must ride to edoras and raise the alarm. do you understand me? yes, mama. i don\\'t want to leave. i don\\'t want to go, mama. freda, i will find you there. quickly! go, child. rohan, my lord  is ready to fall. theodred. find the king\\'s son! mordor will pay for this. these orcs are not from mordor. my lord eomer, over here! he\\'s alive. theodred. your son is badly wounded, my lord. he was ambushed by orcs. if we don\\'t defend our country, saruman will take it by force. that is a lie. saruman the white has ever been our friend and ally. grima. grima. grima. orcs are roaming freely across our lands. unchecked. unchallenged. killing at will. orcs bearing the white hand of saruman. why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind? can you not see? your uncle is wearied by your malcontent  your warmongering. warmongering? how long is it since saruman bought you? what was the promised price, grima? when all the men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure? too long have you watched my sister. too long have you haunted her steps. you see much, eomer, son of eomund. too much. you are banished forthwith from the kingdom of rohan  and all its domains under pain of death. you have no authority here. your orders mean nothing. this order does not come from me. it comes from the king. he signed it this morning. keep breathing. that\\'s the key. breathe. they\\'ve run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them. we\\'re not going no further  until we\\'ve had a breather. get a fire going! merry! merry! i think we might have made a mistake leaving the shire, pippin. what\\'s making that noise? it\\'s the trees. what? you remember the old forest, on the borders of buckland? folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall  and come alive. alive? trees that could whisper  talk to each other  even move. i\\'m starving. we ain\\'t had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days. yeah! why can\\'t we have some meats?! what about them? they\\'re fresh. they are not for eating. what about their legs? they don\\'t need those. they look tasty. get back, scum! the prisoners go to saruman. alive and unspoiled. alive? why alive? do they give good sport? they have something. an elvish weapon. the master wants it for the war. they think we have the ring. as soon as they find out we don\\'t, we\\'re dead. just a mouthful  a bit of the flank. looks like meat\\'s back on the menu, boys. pippin. let\\'s go. go on. call for help. squeal. no one\\'s gonna save you now. pippin! a red sun rises. blood has been spilled this night. riders of rohan  what news from the mark? what business does an elf, a man and a dwarf have in the riddermark? speak quickly! give me your name, horse-master, and i shall give you mine. i would cut off your head, dwarf  if it stood but a little higher from the ground. you would die before your stroke fell. i am aragorn, son of arathorn. this is gimli, son of gloin, and legolas of the woodland realm. we are friends of rohan and of theoden, your king. theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe. not even his own kin. saruman has poisoned the mind of the king  and claimed lordship over these lands. my company are those loyal to rohan. and for that, we are banished. the white wizard is cunning. he walks here and there, they say  as an old man hooded and cloaked. and everywhere, his spies slip past our nets. we are no spies. we track a party of uruk-hai westward across the plain. they have taken two of our friends captive. the uruks are destroyed. we slaughtered them during the night. but there were two hobbits. did you see two hobbits with them? they would be small. only children to your eyes. we left none alive. we piled the carcasses and burned them. dead? i am sorry. hasufel! arod! may these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters. farewell. look for your friends. but do not trust to hope. it has forsaken these lands. we ride north! it\\'s one of their wee belts. may they find peace after death. we failed them. a hobbit lay here. and the other. they crawled. their hands were bound. their bonds were cut. they ran over here. they were followed. the belt! run! tracks lead away from the battle  into fangorn forest. fangorn? what madness drove them in there? did we lose him? i think we lost him. i\\'m going to rip out your filthy little innards! come here! trees. climb a tree. he\\'s gone. merry! let\\'s put a maggot hole in your belly! run, merry! little orcs. bru-ra-hroom. it\\'s talking, merry. the tree is talking. tree? i am no tree! i am an ent. a tree-herder. a shepherd of the forest. don\\'t talk to it, merry. don\\'t encourage it! treebeard, some call me. and whose side are you on? side? i am on nobody\\'s side  because nobody\\'s on my side, little orc. nobody cares for the woods anymore. we\\'re not orcs! we\\'re hobbits! hobbits? never heard of a hobbit before. sounds like orc mischief to me! they come with fire. they come with axes. gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning! destroyers and usurpers! curse them! no! you don\\'t understand. we\\'re hobbits! halflings! shire-folk! maybe you are  and maybe you aren\\'t. the white wizard will know. the white wizard? saruman. see? see? we\\'ve led you out. hurry, hobbitses. hurry! very lucky we find you. nice hobbit. it\\'s a bog. he\\'s led us into a swamp. a swamp, yes, yes. come, master. we will take you on safe paths through the mist. come, hobbits! come! we go quickly. i found it. i did. the way through the marshes. orcs don\\'t use it. orcs don\\'t know it. they go round for miles and miles. come quickly. soft and quick as shadows we must be. i hate this place. it\\'s too quiet. there\\'s been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days. no, no birdses to eat. no crunchable birdses. we are famished! yes! famished we are, precious! here. what does it eats? is it tasty? it tries to chokes us! we can\\'t eats hobbit food! we must starve! well, starve, then. and good riddance! oh, cruel hobbit. it does not care if we be hungry. it does not care if we should die. not like master. master cares. master knows. yes. precious. once it takes hold of us  it never lets go. don\\'t touch me! there are dead things! dead faces in the water. all dead. all rotten. elves and men and orcses. a great battle long ago. dead marshes. yes. yes, that is their name. this way. don\\'t follow the lights. careful now! or hobbits go down to join the dead ones  and light little candles of their own. frodo! gollum? don\\'t follow the lights. gollum! mr. frodo! are you all right? so bright. so beautiful. our precious. what did you say? master should be resting. master needs to keep up his strength. who are you? mustn\\'t ask us. not its business. gollum. gollum. gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk. cold be heart and hand and bone cold be travelers far from home he said your life was a sad story. they do not see what lies ahead when sun has failed and moon is dead you were not so very different from a hobbit once. were you? smeagol. what did you call me? that was your name once, wasn\\'t it? a long time ago. my name. my name. smeagol. black riders! hide! hide! come on, frodo. come on! quick! they will see us! they will see us! i thought they were dead. dead? no, you cannot kill them. no. wraiths! wraiths on wings! they are calling for it. they are calling for the precious. mr. frodo! it\\'s all right. i\\'m here. hurry, hobbits. the black gate is very close. orc blood. these are strange tracks. the air is so close in here. this forest is old. very old. full of memory  and anger. the trees are speaking to each other. gimli! lower your ax. they have feelings, my friend. the elves began it. waking up the trees, teaching them to speak. talking trees. what do trees have to talk about? except the consistency of squirrel droppings. aragorn, something is out there! what do you see? the white wizard approaches. do not let him speak. he will put a spell on us. we must be quick. you are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits. where are they? they passed this way the day before yesterday. they met someone they did not expect. does that comfort you? who are you? show yourself! it cannot be. forgive me. i mistook you for saruman. i am saruman. or rather, saruman as he should have been. you fell. through fire  and water. from the lowest dungeon to the highest peak  i fought with the balrog of morgoth. until at last i threw down my enemy  and smote his ruin upon the mountainside. darkness took me  and i strayed out of thought and time. stars wheeled overhead  and every day was as long as a life age of the earth. but it was not the end. i felt life in me again. i\\'ve been sent back  until my task is done. gandalf. gandalf? yes. that was what they used to call me. gandalf the grey. that was my name. gandalf. i am gandalf the white. and i come back to you now  at the turn of the tide. one stage of your journey is over. another begins. we must travel to edoras with all speed. edoras? that is no short distance! we hear of trouble in rohan. it goes ill with the king. yes, and it will not be easily cured. then we have run all this way for nothing? are we to leave those poor hobbits here  in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested ? i mean, charming  quite charming forest. it was more than mere chance that brought merry and pippin to fangorn. a great power has been sleeping here for many long years. the coming of merry and pippin will be like the falling of small stones  that starts an avalanche in the mountains. in one thing you have not changed, dear friend. you still speak in riddles. a thing is about to happen that has not happened since the elder days. the ents are going to wake up  and find that they are strong. strong?! oh, that\\'s good. so stop your fretting, master dwarf. merry and pippin are quite safe. in fact, they are far safer than you are about to be. this new gandalf\\'s more grumpy than the old one. that is one of the mearas  unless my eyes are cheated by some spell. shadowfax. he is the lord of all horses  and has been my friend through many dangers. o rowan mine i saw you shine upon a summer\\'s day upon your head how golden-red the crown you bore aloft such a beautiful verse. is it much further? bru-ra-hroom. don\\'t be hasty. you might call it far, perhaps. my home lies deep in the forest  near the roots of the mountain. i told gandalf i would keep you safe. and safe is where i\\'ll keep you. i believe you will enjoy this next one too. it\\'s one of my own compositions. right. beneath the roof of sleeping leaves and the dreams of trees unfold when woodland halls are green and cool and the wind is in the west come back to me come back to me and say my land is best sleep, little shirelings. heed no nightly noise. sleep till morning light. i have business in the forest. there are many to call. many that must come. the shadow lies on fangorn. the withering of all woods is drawing near. the veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape. sauron will suffer no rival. from the summit of barad-dur, his eye watches ceaselessly. but he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear. doubt ever gnaws at him. the rumor has reached him. the heir of numenor still lives. sauron fears you, aragorn. he fears what you may become. and so he\\'ll strike hard and fast at the world of men. he will use his puppet saruman to destroy rohan. war is coming. rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge  for rohan is weak and ready to fall. the king\\'s mind is enslaved, it\\'s an old device of saruman\\'s. his hold over king theoden is now very strong. sauron and saruman are tightening the noose. but for all their cunning  we have one advantage. the ring remains hidden. and that we should seek to destroy it  has not yet entered their darkest dreams. and so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards mordor  in the hands of a hobbit. each day brings it closer to the fires of mount doom. we must trust now in frodo. everything depends upon speed  and the secrecy of his quest. do not regret your decision to leave him. frodo must finish this task alone. he\\'s not alone. sam went with him. did he? did he, indeed? good. yes, very good. the black gate of mordor. oh, save us. my old gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now. master says to show him the way into mordor. so good smeagol does, master says so. i did. that\\'s it, then. we can\\'t get past that. look! the gate. it\\'s opening! i can see a way down. sam, no! master! i do not ask you to come with me, sam. i know, mr. frodo. i doubt even these elvish cloaks will hide us in there. now! no! no! no, master! they catch you! they catch you! don\\'t take it to him. he wants the precious. always he is looking for it. and the precious is wanting to go back to him. but we mustn\\'t let him have it. no! there\\'s another way. more secret. a dark way. why haven\\'t you spoken of this before? because master did not ask. he\\'s up to something. are you saying there\\'s another way into mordor? yes. there\\'s a path  and some stairs. and then  a tunnel. he\\'s led us this far, sam. mr. frodo, no. he\\'s been true to his word. no. lead the way, smeagol. good smeagol always helps. hello? treebeard? where has he gone? i had the loveliest dream last night. there was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed. and we smoked all of it. and then  you were sick. i\\'d give anything for a whiff of old toby. did you hear that? there it is again. something\\'s not right here. not right at all. you just said something treeish. no, i didn\\'t. i was just stretching. you\\'re taller. who? you! than what? than me! i\\'ve always been taller than you. pippin, everyone knows i\\'m the tall one. you\\'re the short one. please, merry. you\\'re what? three-foot-six? at the most? whereas me, i\\'m pushing 3\\'7\". 3\\'8\"! three-foot-eight. you did something. merry, don\\'t! don\\'t drink it! merry! treebeard said, treebeard said you shouldn\\'t have any. i want some! he said it could well be dangerous! give me it back. merry! what\\'s happening?! it\\'s got my leg! merry! help! away with you. you should not be waking. eat earth. dig deep. drink water. go to sleep. away with you. come, the forest is waking up. it isn\\'t safe. the trees have grown wild and dangerous. anger festers in their hearts. black are their thoughts. strong is their hate. they will harm you if they can. there are too few of us now. too few of us ents left to manage them. why are there so few of you when you have lived so long? are there ent children? bru-ra-hroom. there have been no entings for a terrible long count of years. why is that? we lost the entwives. oh, i\\'m sorry. how did they die? die? no. we lost them. and now we cannot find them. i don\\'t suppose you\\'ve seen entwives in the shire? can\\'t say that i have. you, pip? what do they look like? i don\\'t remember now. edoras and the golden hall of meduseld. there dwells theoden, king of rohan  whose mind is overthrown. saruman\\'s hold over king theoden is now very strong. my lord, your son  he is dead. my lord? uncle? will you not go to him? will you do nothing? be careful what you say. do not look for welcome here. oh, he he must have died sometime in the night. what a tragedy for the king  to lose his only son and heir. i understand. his passing is hard to accept. especially now that your brother has deserted you. leave me alone, snake! oh, but you are alone. who knows what you\\'ve spoken to the darkness  in the bitter watches of the night  when all your life seems to shrink. the walls of your bower closing in about you. a hutch to trammel some wild thing in. so fair. so cold. like a morning of pale spring  still clinging to winter\\'s chill. your words are poison. you\\'ll find more cheer in a graveyard. i cannot allow you before theoden king so armed, gandalf greyhame. by order of grima wormtongue. your staff. you would not part an old man from his walking stick. my lord, gandalf the grey is coming. he\\'s a herald of woe. the courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late  theoden king. he\\'s not welcome. why should i welcome you  gandalf stormcrow? a just question, my liege. late is the hour  in which this conjurer chooses to appear. lathspell i name him. ill news is an ill guest. be silent. keep your forked tongue behind your teeth. i have not passed through fire and death  to bandy crooked words with a witless worm. his staff. i told you to take the wizard\\'s staff. theoden  son of thengel  too long have you sat in the shadows. i would stay still if i were you. hearken to me! i release you  from the spell. you have no power here  gandalf the grey. i will draw you, saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound. wait. if i go, theoden dies. you did not kill me  you will not kill him. rohan is mine. be gone. i know your face. eowyn. eowyn. gandalf? breathe the free air again, my friend. dark have been my dreams of late. your fingers would remember their old strength better  if they grasped your sword. i\\'ve only  ever served you, my lord. your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast! send me not from your sight. no, my lord! no, my lord. let him go. enough blood has been spilt on his account. get out of my way! hail, theoden king! where is theodred? where is my son? an evil death has set forth the noble warrior  a song shall sing sorrowing minstrels. in meduseld  that he is no more  for his necessary rest. and that he is the dearest kinsman  killing took him  simbelmyn. ever has it grown on the tombs of my forbearers. now it shall cover the grave of my son. alas that these evil days should be mine. the young perish and the old linger. that i should live  to see the last days of my house. theodred\\'s death was not of your making. no parent should have to bury their child. he was strong in life. his spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers. be thou well. go thou, théodred, go thou. they had no warning. they were unarmed. now the wild men are moving through the westfold, burning as they go. rick, cot and tree. where is mama? this is but a taste of the terror that saruman will unleash. all the more potent for he is driven now by fear of sauron. ride out and meet him head on. draw him away from your women and children. you must fight. you have 2000 good men riding north as we speak. eomer is loyal to you. his men will return and fight for their king. they will be 300 leagues from here by now. eomer cannot help us. i know what it is you want of me  but i will not bring further death to my people. i will not risk open war. open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not. when last i looked  theoden, not aragorn, was king of rohan. then what is the king\\'s decision? by order of the king  the city must empty. we make for the refuge of helm\\'s deep. do not burden yourself with treasures. take only what provisions you need. helm\\'s deep. they flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight. who will defend them if not their king? he\\'s only doing what he thinks is best for his people. helm\\'s deep has saved them in the past. there is no way out of that ravine. theoden is walking into a trap. he thinks he\\'s leading them to safety. what they will get is a massacre. theoden has a strong will, but i fear for him. i fear for the survival of rohan. he will need you before the end, aragorn. the people of rohan will need you. the defenses have to hold. they will hold. the grey pilgrim. that\\'s what they used to call me. three hundred lives of men i\\'ve walked this earth, and now i have no time. with luck, my search will not be in vain. look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. at dawn, look to the east. go. that horse is half mad, my lord. there\\'s nothing you can do. leave him. fast  quiet now. fast  quiet  quiet  quiet  quiet  a battle is stirring, you heard. what is your name? what is your name? his name is brego. he was my cousin\\'s horse. brego. your name is kingly. what troubles you, brego? what did you see? i have heard of the magic of elves  but i did not look for it in a ranger from the north. you speak as one of their own. i was raised in rivendell  for a time. turn this fellow free. he\\'s seen enough of war. gandalf the white. gandalf the fool! does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety? there were three who followed the wizard. an elf, a dwarf and a man. you stink of horse. the man  was he from gondor? no, from the north. one of the dunedain rangers, i thought he was. his cloth was poor. and yet he bore a strange ring. two serpents with emerald eyes. one devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers. the ring of barahir. so gandalf greyhame thinks he has found isildur\\'s heir. the lost king of gondor. he is a fool. the line was broken years ago. it matters not. the world of men shall fall. it will begin at edoras. i am ready, gamling. bring my horse. this is not a defeat. we will return. we will return. you have some skill with a blade. women of this country learned long ago: those without swords can still die upon them. i fear neither death nor pain. what do you fear, my lady? a cage. to stay behind bars until use and old age accept them. and all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire. you\\'re a daughter of kings  a shield maiden of rohan. i do not think that would be your fate. theoden will not stay at edoras. it\\'s vulnerable. he knows this. he will expect an attack on the city. they will flee to helm\\'s deep  the great fortress of rohan. it is a dangerous road to take through the mountains. they will be slow. they will have women and children with them. send out your warg-riders. hey, stinker, don\\'t go getting too far ahead. why do you do that? what? call him names. run him down all the time. because. because that\\'s what he is, mr. frodo. there\\'s naught left in him but lies and deceit. it\\'s the ring he wants. it\\'s all he cares about. you have no idea what it did to him  what it\\'s still doing to him. i want to help him, sam. why? because i have to believe he can come back. you can\\'t save him, mr. frodo. what do you know about it? nothing! i\\'m sorry, sam. i don\\'t know why i said that. i do. it\\'s the ring. you can\\'t take your eyes off it. i\\'ve seen you. you\\'re not eating. you barely sleep. it\\'s taken hold of you, mr. frodo. you have to fight it. i know what i have to do, sam. the ring was entrusted to me. it\\'s my task. mine! my own! can\\'t you hear yourself? don\\'t you know who you sound like? we wants it. we needs it. must have the precious. they stole it from us. sneaky little hobbitses. wicked. tricksy. false. no. not master. yes, precious. false. they will cheat you, hurt you, lie! master\\'s my friend. you don\\'t have any friends. nobody likes you. not listening. i\\'m not listening. you\\'re a liar and a thief. no. murderer. go away. go away? i hate you. i hate you. where would you be without me? gollum. gollum. i saved us. it was me. we survived because of me. not anymore. what did you say? master looks after us now. we don\\'t need you. what? leave now  and never come back. no. leave now and never come back. leave now and never come back! we we told him to go away. and away he goes, precious. gone! gone! gone! smeagol is free! look. look. see what smeagol finds? they are young. they are tender. they are nice. yes, they are. eat them. eat them! you\\'ll make him sick, you will  behaving like that. there\\'s only one way to eat a brace of coneys. what\\'s it doing? stupid, fat hobbit. it ruins it. what\\'s to ruin? there\\'s hardly any meat on \\'em. waht we need\\'s a few good taters. what\\'s taters, precious? what\\'s taters? eh? po-ta-toes. boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew. lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish. even you couldn\\'t say no to that. oh, yes, we could. spoil a nice fish. give it to us raw  and wriggling. you keep nasty chips. you\\'re hopeless. mr. frodo? who are they? wicked men. servants of sauron. they are called to mordor. the dark one is gathering all armies to him. it won\\'t be long now. he will soon be ready. ready to do what? to make his war. the last war that will cover all the world in shadow. we\\'ve got to get moving. come on, sam. mr. frodo. look. it\\'s an oliphaunt. no one at home will believe this. smeagol? we\\'ve lingered here too long. come on, sam. wait! we\\'re innocent travelers! there are no travelers in this land. only servants of the dark tower. we are bound to an errand of secrecy. those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us. the enemy? his sense of duty was no less than yours, i deem. you wonder what his name is  where he came from. and if he was really evil at heart. what lies or threats led him on this long march from home. if he would not rather have stayed there  in peace. war will make corpses of us all. bind their hands. it\\'s true, you don\\'t see many dwarf women. and in fact, they are so alike inice and appearance  that they\\'re often mistaken for dwarf men. it\\'s the beards. this, in turn, has given rise to the belief  that there are no dwarf women  and that dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground  which is, of course, ridiculous. it\\'s all right. it\\'s all right. nobody panic. that was deliberate. it was deliberate. i haven\\'t seen my niece smile for a long time. she was a girl when they brought her father back dead. cut down by orcs. she watched her mother succumb to grief. then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear. doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father. gimli. no, i couldn\\'t i really couldn\\'t. i made some stew. it isn\\'t much, but it\\'s hot. thank you. it\\'s good. really? my uncle told me a strange thing. he said that you rode to war with thengel, my grandfather. but he must be mistaken. king theoden has a good memory. he was only a small child at the time. then you must be at least 60. seventy? but you cannot be 80! eighty-seven. you are one of the dunedain. a descendant of numenor, blessed with long life. it was said that your race had passed into legend. there are few of us left. the northern kingdom was destroyed long ago. i\\'m sorry. please, eat. the light of the evenstar does not wax and wane. it is mine to give to whom i will. like my heart. go to sleep. i am asleep. this is a dream. then it is a good dream. sleep. you told me once  this day would come. this is not the end it is the beginning. you must go with frodo. that is your path. my path is hidden from me. it is already laid before your feet. you cannot falter now. arwen  if you trust nothing else  trust this  trust us. where is she? the woman who gave you that jewel. our time here is ending. arwen\\'s time is ending. let her go. let her take the ship into the west. let her bear away her love for you to the undying lands. there it will be ever green. but never more than memory. i will not leave my daughter here to die. she stays because she still has hope. she stays for you. she belongs with her people. sharepirate.com subs is this how you leave? did you think you could slip away at first light unseen? i shall not return. you underestimate your skill in battle. you will return. i do not speak of death in battle. what do you speak of? the way is open to you  the way to another life  away from war grief, despair. why are you saying this? i am mortal. you are elf-kind. it was a dream, arwen. nothing more. i don\\'t believe you. this belongs to you. it was a gift. keep it. my lord? she is sailing to the undying lands with all that is left of her kin. what is it? hama? i\\'m not sure. wargs! a scout! what is it? what do you see? warg! we\\'re under attack! get them out of here! all riders to the head of the column. come on. get me up here. i\\'m a rider. come on! you must lead the people to helm\\'s deep, and make haste. i can fight. no! you must do this, for me. follow me! forward. i mean, charge forward. make for the lower ground! that\\'s it! go on! stay together! bring your pretty face to my ax. that one counts as mine! stinking creature. aragorn! aragorn? tell me what happened and i will ease your passing. he\\'s  dead. he took a little tumble off the cliff. you lie. get the wounded on horses. the wolves of isengard will return. leave the dead. come. at last! helm\\'s deep. there it is, helm\\'s deep. we\\'re safe! we\\'re safe, my lady. thank you. mama! eothain! freda! where is the rest? this is all we could save, my lady. take it to the caves. make way for the king. make way for theoden. make way for the king. so few. so few of you have returned. our people are safe. we have paid for it with many lives. my lady. lord aragorn  where is he? he fell. draw all our forces behind the wall. bar the gate. and set a watch on the surround. what of those who cannot fight, my lord? the women and children? get them into the caves. saruman\\'s arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here. helm\\'s deep has one weakness. its outer wall is solid rock  but for a small culvert at its base  which is little more than a drain. how? how can fire undo stone? what kind of device could bring down the wall? if the wall is breached, helm\\'s deep will fall. even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning  thousands, to storm the keep. tens of thousands. but, my lord, there is no such force. a new power is rising. its victory is at hand. this night  the land will be stained with the blood of rohan! march to helm\\'s deep! leave none alive! to war! there will be no dawn for men. look. there\\'s smoke to the south. there is always smoke rising  from isengard these days. isengard? there was a time  when saruman would walk in my woods. but now he has a mind of metal  and wheels. he no longer cares for growing things. what is it? it\\'s saruman\\'s army. the war has started. may the grace of the valar protect you. brego. arwen. it is time. the ships are leaving for valinor. go now before it is too late. i have made my choice. he is not coming back. why do you linger here when there is no hope? there is still hope. if aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted. if sauron is defeated and aragorn made king  and all that you hope for comes true  you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality. whether by the sword or the slow decay of time  aragorn will die. and there will be no comfort for you  no comfort to ease the pain of his passing. he will come to death  an image of the splendor of the kings of men  in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world. but you, my daughter  you will linger on in darkness and in doubt  as nightfall in winter that comes without a star. here you will dwell  bound to your grief under the fading trees  until all the world is changed  and the long years of your life are utterly spent. arwen. there is nothing for you here  only death. and i, do i not have your love? you have my love, father. the world is changed. i feel it in the water. i feel it in the earth, and i smell it in the air. the power of the enemy is growing. sauron will use his puppet, saruman  to destroy the people of rohan. isengard has been unleashed. the eye of sauron now turns to gondor  the last free kingdom of men. his war on this country will come swiftly. he senses the ring is close. the strength of the ring-bearer is failing. in his heart, frodo begins to understand  the quest will claim his life. you know this. you have foreseen it. it is the risk we all took. in the gathering dark, the will of the ring grows strong. it works hard now to find its way back into the hands of men. men, who are so easily seduced by its power. the young captain of gondor has but to extend his hand  take the ring for his own, and the world will fall. it is close now. so close to achieving its goal. for sauron will have dominion over all life on this earth  even unto to the ending of the world. the time of the elves  is over. do we leave middle-earth to its fate? do we let them stand alone? what news? our scouts report saruman has attacked rohan. theoden\\'s people have fled to helm\\'s deep. but we must look to our own borders. faramir, orcs are on the move. sauron is marshaling an army. easterlings and southrons are passing through the black gate. how many? some thousands. more come every day. who\\'s covering the river to the north? we pulled 500 men at osgiliath. if their city is attacked, we won\\'t hold it. saruman attacks from isengard. sauron from mordor. the fight will come to men on both fronts. gondor is weak. sauron will strike us soon. and he will strike hard. he knows now we do not have the strength to repel him. my men tell me that you are orc spies. spies? now wait just a minute. well, if you\\'re not spies, then who are you? speak. we are hobbits of the shire. frodo baggins is my name, and this is samwise gamgee. your bodyguard? his gardener. and where is your skulking friend? that gangrel creature. he had an ill-favored look. there was no other. we set out from rivendell with seven companions. one we lost in moria  two were my kin  a dwarf there was also. and an elf and two men. aragorn, son of arathorn, and boromir of gondor. you\\'re a friend of boromir? yes. for my part. it will grieve you then to learn that he is dead. dead? how? when? as one of his companions, i\\'d hoped you would tell me. if something has happened to boromir, we would have you tell us. his horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past. it was cloven in two. but more than this, i know it in my heart. he was my brother. boromir! boromir! this city was once the jewel of our kingdom. a place of light and beauty and music. and so it shall be once more! let the armies of mordor know this: never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands. this city of osgiliath has been reclaimed for gondor! for gondor! for gondor! for gondor! for gondor! good speech. nice and short. leaves more time for drinking! break out the ale! these men are thirsty! remember today, little brother. today, life is good. what? he\\'s here. one moment of peace, can he not give us that? where is he? where is gondor\\'s finest? where is my first-born? father! they say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handed. they exaggerate. the victory belongs to faramir also. but for faramir, this city would still be standing. were you not entrusted to protect it? i would have done, but our numbers were too few. oh, too few. you let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim. always you cast a poor reflection on me. that is not my intent. you give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will. he loves you, father. do not trouble me with faramir  i know his uses, and they are few. we have more urgent things to speak of. elrond of rivendell has called a meeting. he will not say why, but i have guessed its purpose. it is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found. the one ring. isildur\\'s bane. and it has fallen into the hands of the elves. everyone will try to claim it: men, dwarves, wizards. we cannot let that happen. this thing must come to gondor. gondor. it\\'s dangerous, i know. ever the ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser men. but you, you are strong. and our need is great. it is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying. sauron is biding his time. he\\'s massing fresh armies. he will return. and when he does, we will be powerless to stop him. you must go. bring me back this mighty gift. no. my place is here with my people. not in rivendell. would you deny your own father? if there is need to go to rivendell  send me in his stead. you? oh, i see. a chance for faramir, captain of gondor, to show his quality. i think not. i trust this mission only to your brother. the one who will not fail me. remember today, little brother. captain faramir! we found the third one. you must come with me. now. down there. to enter the forbidden pool bears the penalty of death. they wait for my command. shall i shoot? the rock and pool is nice and cool so juicy sweet our only wish to catch a fish so juicy sweet wait. this creature is bound to me. and i to him. he is our guide. please  let me go down to him. smeagol. master is here. come, smeagol. trust master. come. we must go now? smeagol, you must trust master. follow me. come on. come. come, smeagol. nice smeagol. that\\'s it. come on. don\\'t hurt him! smeagol, don\\'t struggle. smeagol, listen to me. master! that\\'s enough. where are you leading them? answer me. smeagol. why does it cry, smeagol? cruel men hurts us. master tricksed us. of course he did. i told you he was tricksy. i told you he was false. master is our friend. our friend. master betrayed us. no. not its business. leave us alone! filthy little hobbitses! they stole it from us! no. no. what did they steal? my precious! we have to get out of here. you go. go, now. you can do it. use the ring, mr. frodo. just this once. put it on. disappear. i can\\'t. you were right, sam. you tried to tell me but  i\\'m sorry. the ring\\'s taking me, sam. if i put it on  he\\'ll find me. he\\'ll see. mr. frodo  so this is the answer to all the riddles. here in the wild i have you  two halflings  and a host of men at my call. the ring of power within my grasp. a chance for faramir, captain of gondor  to show his quality. no! stop it! leave him alone. don\\'t you understand? he\\'s got to destroy it! that\\'s where we\\'re going, into mordor. to the mountain of fire! osgiliath is under attack. they call for reinforcements. please. it\\'s such a burden. will you not help him? captain? prepare to leave. the ring will go to gondor. well done, brego, my friend. he\\'s alive! where is he? where is he? get out of the way! i\\'m gonna kill him! you are the luckiest, the canniest  and the most reckless man i ever knew. bless you, laddie. gimli, where is the king? you\\'re late. you look terrible. thank you. a great host, you say? all isengard is emptied. how many? ten thousand strong at least. ten thousand? it is an army bred for a single purpose: to destroy the world of men. they will be here by nightfall. let them come! i want every man and strong lad able to bear arms  to be ready for battle by nightfall. we will cover the causeway and the gate from above. no army has ever breached the deeping wall  or set foot inside the hornburg! this is no rabble of mindless orcs. these are uruk-hai. their armor is thick and their shields broad. i have fought many wars, master dwarf. i know how to defend my own keep. they will break upon this fortress like water on rock. saruman\\'s hordes will pillage and burn. we\\'ve seen it before. crops can be resown  homes rebuilt. within these walls  we will outlast them. they do not come to destroy rohan\\'s crops or villages. they come to destroy its people  down to the last child. what would you have me do? look at my men. their courage hangs by a thread. if this is to be our end, then i would have them make such an end  as to be worthy of remembrance. send out riders, my lord. you must call for aid. and who will come? elves? dwarves? we are not so lucky in our friends as you. the old alliances are dead. gondor will answer. gondor?! where was gondor when the westfold fell?! where was gondor when our enemies closed in around us?! where was gon ? no, my lord aragorn  we are alone. get the women and children into the caves. we need more time to lay provisions  there is no time. war is upon us. secure the gate. we ents have not troubled  about the wars of men and wizards  for a very long time. but now, something is about to happen  that has not happened  for an age. entmoot. what\\'s that? \\'tis a gathering. a gathering of what? beech. oak. chestnut. ash. good. good. good. many have come. now we must decide if the ents  will go to war. move back! move to the caves! come on, people! quickly, now! we\\'ll place the reserves along the wall. they can support the archers from above the gate. aragorn, you must rest. you\\'re no use to us half alive. my lord! aragorn! i\\'m to be sent with the women into the caves. that is an honorable charge. to mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return. what renown is there in that? my lady, a time may come for valor without renown. who then will your people look to in the last defense? let me stand at your side. it is not in my power to command it. you do not command the others to stay! they fight beside you because they would not be parted from you. because they love you. i\\'m sorry. farmers, farriers, stable boys. these are no soldiers. most have seen too many winters. or too few. look at them. they\\'re frightened. i can see it in their eyes. and they should be three hundred… against ten thousand they have more hope of defending themselves here than at edoras aragorn, they cannot win this fight. they are all going to die! then i shall die as one of them! let him go, lad. let him be. every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory. my lord? who am i, gamling? you are our king, sire. and do you trust your king? your men, my lord  will follow you to whatever end. to whatever end. where is the horse and the rider? where is the horn that was blowing? they have passed like rain on the mountains. like wind in the meadow. the days have gone down in the west  behind the hills  into shadow. how did it come to this? it\\'s been going for hours. they must have decided something by now. decided? no. we only just finished saying  good morning. but it\\'s nighttime already. you can\\'t take forever. don\\'t be hasty. we\\'re running out of time! move! move to the outer wall. give me your sword. what is your name? haleth, son of hama, my lord. the men are saying that we will not live out the night. they say that it is hopeless. this is a good sword. haleth, son of hama  there is always hope. we have trusted you this far. you have not led us astray. forgive me. i was wrong to despair. there is nothing to forgive, legolas. we had time, i\\'d get this adjusted. it\\'s a little tight across the chest. that is no orc horn. send for the king. open the gate! open up the gate! how is this possible? i bring word from elrond of rivendell. an alliance once existed between elves and men. long ago we fought and died together. we come to honor that allegiance. well met, haldir! you are most welcome. we are proud to fight alongside men once more. you could have picked a better spot. well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let\\'s hope it lasts the night. your friends are with you, aragorn. let\\'s hope they last the night. o, children of eru  show them no mercy… for you shall receive none! what\\'s happening out there? shall i describe it to you? or would you like me to find you a box? hold! so it begins. prepare to fire! their armour is weak… at the throat  and beneath the arm. release arrows! did they hit anything? give them alley. fire! fire! send them to me! come on! ladders! good! swords! swords! legolas! two already! i\\'m on 17! i\\'ll have no pointy-ear outscoring me! nineteen! merry. we have just agreed. yes? i have told your names to the entmoot  and we have agreed  you are not orcs. well, that\\'s good news. and what about saruman? have you come to a decision about him? now, don\\'t be hasty, master meriadoc. hasty? our friends are out there. they need our help. they cannot fight this war on their own. war? yes. it affects us all. tree, root and twig. but you must understand, young hobbit  it takes a long time  to say anything in old entish  and we never say anything  unless it is worth taking  a long time to say. seventeen! eighteen! nineteen! twenty! twenty-one! causeway! towards the causeway! is this it? is this is all you can conjure, saruman? bring him down, legolas! kill him! kill him! brace the gate! hold them! stand firm! aragorn! gimli! hurl the arrows! charge! the ents cannot hold back this storm. we must weather such things as we have always done. how can that be your decision?! this is not our war. but you\\'re part of this world! aren\\'t you?! you must help. please. you must do something. you are young and brave, master merry. but your part in this tale is over. go back to your home. maybe treebeard\\'s right. we don\\'t belong here, merry. it\\'s too big for us. what can we do in the end? we\\'ve got the shire. maybe we should go home. the fires of isengard will spread  and the woods of tuckborough and buckland will burn. and  and all that was once green and good in this world will be gone. there won\\'t be a shire, pippin. aragorn! fall back to the keep! get your men out of there! to the keep! pull back! haldir! pull back! what are you doing? what are you stopping for? pull back! haldir! brace the gate! hold them! to the gate. draw your swords! make way! we cannot hold much longer! hold them!  how long do you need? as long as you can give me. gimli! timbers! brace the gate! come on. we can take \\'em. it\\'s a long way. toss me. what? i cannot jump the distance! you\\'ll have to toss me! don\\'t tell the elf. not a word. shore up the door! make way! follow me to the barricade. watch our backs! throw another one over here! higher! hold fast the gate! gimli! aragorn! get out of there! aragorn! pull everybody back. pull them back. fall back! fall back! they have broken through! the castle is breached. retreat! fall back! retreat! hurry! inside. get them inside! into the keep! i will leave you at the western borders of the forest. you can make your way north to your homeland from there. wait! stop! stop! turn around. turn around. take us south. south? but that will lead you past isengard. yes. exactly. if we go south, we can slip past saruman unnoticed. the closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm. it\\'s the last thing he\\'ll expect. that doesn\\'t make sense to me. but then  you are very small. perhaps you\\'re right. south it is, then. hold on, little shirelings. i always like going south. somehow it feels like going downhill. are you mad? we\\'ll be caught. no, we won\\'t. not this time. look! osgiliath burns! mordor has come. the ring will not save gondor. it has only the power to destroy. please  let me go. hurry. faramir! you must let me go! and those little family of field mice  that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully. they\\'re always trying to get somewhere where they  many of these trees were my friends. creatures i had known from nut and acorn. i\\'m sorry, treebeard. they hadices of their own. saruman. a wizard should know better! there is no curse in elvish  entish or the tongues of men  for this treachery. look! the trees! they\\'re moving! where are they going? they have business with the orcs. my business is with isengard tonight  with rock and stone. yes. come, my friends. the ents are going to war. it is likely  that we go to our doom. last march  of the ents. faramir! orcs have taken the eastern shore. their numbers are too great. by nightfall we will be overrun. mr. frodo? it\\'s calling to him, sam. his eye is almost on me. hold on, mr. frodo. you\\'ll be all right. take them to my father. tell him faramir sends a mighty gift. a weapon that will change our fortunes in this war. do you want to know what happened to boromir? you want to know why your brother died? he tried to take the ring from frodo after swearing an oath to protect him! he tried to kill him! the ring drove your brother mad! watch out! mr. frodo? they\\'re here. they\\'ve come. nazgul! stay here. keep out of sight. take cover! the fortress is taken. it is over. you said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it. they still defend it. they have died defending it. they\\'re breaking in! they\\'re past the door! is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves? is there no other way? there is one passage. it leads into the mountains. but they will not get far. the uruk-hai are too many. send word for the women and children to make for the mountain pass. and barricade the entrance! so much death. what can men do against such reckless hate? ride out with me. ride out and meet them. for death and glory. for rohan. for your people. the sun is rising. look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. at dawn  look to the east. yes. yes. the horn of helm hammerhand  shall sound in the deep  one last time. yes! let this be the hour when we draw swords together. fell deeds, awake. now for wrath  now for ruin and a red dawn. forth eorlingas! gandalf. theoden king stands alone. not alone. rohirrim! eomer. to the king! yes! a hit. a fine hit. break the dam! release the river! pippin! hold on! hold on, little hobbits. what are you doing? where are you going? it\\'s me. it\\'s your sam. don\\'t you know your sam? i can\\'t do this, sam. i know. it\\'s all wrong. by rights, we shouldn\\'t even be here. but we are. it\\'s like in the great stories, mr. frodo. the ones that really mattered. full of darkness and danger they were. and sometimes you didn\\'t want to know the end  because how could the end be happy? how could the world go back to the way it was  when so much bad had happened? victory! we have victory! but in the end, it\\'s only a passing thing  this shadow. even darkness must pass. a new day will come. and when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer. those were the stories that stayed with you  that meant something. even if you were too small to understand why. but i think, mr. frodo, i do understand. i know now. folk in those stories  had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn\\'t. they kept going  because they were holding on to something. what are we holding on to, sam? that there\\'s some good in this world, mr. frodo. and it\\'s worth fighting for. i think at last we understand one another, frodo baggins. you know the laws of our country, the laws of your father. if you let them go, your life will be forfeit. then it is forfeit. release them. stay out of the forest! keep away from the trees! final count  42 forty-two? oh, that\\'s not bad for a pointy-eared elvish princeling. i myself am sitting pretty on 43. forty-three. he was already dead. he was twitching. he was twitching  because he\\'s got my ax embedded in his nervous system! he doesn\\'t look too happy, does he? not too happy at all, merry. still, i suppose the view would be quite nice from up there. oh, yes. it\\'s a quality establishment. i hear the staff are very good. what are you doing? nothing. the world\\'s back to normal, that\\'s all. no, it isn\\'t. i\\'m starving. good luck trying to find something decent to eat around here. probably only dead rats and moldy bread. saruman\\'s storeroom! i don\\'t believe it. it can\\'t be. it is! longbottom leaf. the finest pipe-weed in the south farthing. it\\'s perfect. one barrel each. wait. do you think we should share it with treebeard? share it? no. no. dead plant and all that. don\\'t think he\\'d understand. could be a distant relative. oh, i get it. don\\'t be hasty. exactly. bar-hrum. this is the old sewer. runs right under the river through to the edge of the city. you\\'ll find cover in the woods there. captain faramir  you have shown your quality, sir. the very highest. the shire must truly be a great realm, master gamgee  where gardeners are held in high honor. what road will you take once you reach the woods? gollum says there\\'s a path  near minas morgul that climbs up into the mountains. cirith ungol? is that its name? no. no! yes. frodo  they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above minas morgul. you cannot go that way. it is the only way. master says we must go to mordor, so we must try. i must. go, frodo. go with the goodwill of all men. thank you. may death find you quickly if you bring them to harm. come on, keep up. mr. frodo didn\\'t mean for them rangers to hurt you. you know that, don\\'t you? he was trying to save you, see? save me? so there\\'s no hard feelings. forgive and forget. no, no, no hard feelings. gollum, gollum. yes, master. nice hobbits. very decent of you. very decent, indeed, gollum. sauron\\'s wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift. the battle for helm\\'s deep is over. the battle for middle-earth is about to begin. all our hopes now lie with two little hobbits  somewhere in the wilderness. i wonder if we\\'ll ever be put into songs or tales. what? i wonder if people will ever say, \"let\\'s hear about frodo and the ring.\" and they\\'ll say, \"yes! that\\'s one of my favorite stories.\" frodo was really courageous, wasn\\'t he, dad? yes, my boy. the most famousest of hobbits. and that\\'s saying a lot. well, you\\'ve left out one of the chief characters: samwise the brave. i want to hear more about sam. frodo wouldn\\'t have got far without sam. now, mr. frodo, you shouldn\\'t make fun. i was being serious. so was i. samwise the brave. smeagol? we\\'re not going to wait for you. come on. master. master looks after us. master wouldn\\'t hurt us. master broke his promise. don\\'t ask smeagol. poor, poor smeagol. master betrayed us. wicked. tricksy. false. we ought to wring his filthy little neck. kill him! kill him! kill them both! and then we take the precious  and we be the master! but the fat hobbit, he knows. eyes always watching. then we stabs them out. put out his eyeses and make him crawl. yes. yes. yes. kill them both. yes. no! no! it\\'s too risky. it\\'s too risky. where is he? where has he gone? hey, gollum! where are you? smeagol? we could let her do it. yes. she could do it. yes, precious, she could. and then we takes it once they\\'re dead. once they\\'re dead. come on, hobbits. long ways to go yet. smeagol will show you the way. follow me. sméagol! i\\'ve got one! i\\'ve got a fish, smeag. smeagol! pull it in. go on. go on. go on. pull it in. deagol! deagol? deagol. give us that, deagol, my love. why? because  it\\'s my birthday and i wants it. my precious. they cursed us. murderer. “murderer” they called us. they cursed us and drove us away. gollum. gollum. gollum. and we wept, precious. we wept to be so alone. and cool so nice for feet and we only wish to catch a fish so juicy sweet and we forgot the taste of bread  the sound of trees  the softness of the wind. we even forgot our own name. my precious. wake up! wake up! wake up, sleepies. we must go, yes. we must go at once. haven\\'t you had any sleep, mr. frodo? i\\'ve gone and had too much. must be getting late. no. it isn\\'t. it isn\\'t midday yet. the days are growing darker. come on! must go! no time! not before mr. frodo\\'s had something to eat. no time to lose, silly. here. what about you? oh, no, i\\'m not hungry. leastways, not for lembas bread. sam. all right. we don\\'t have that much left. we have to be careful or we\\'re going to run out. you go ahead and eat that, mr. frodo. i\\'ve rationed it. there should be enough. for what? the journey home. come, hobbitses. very close now. very close to mordor. no safe places here. hurry. it\\'s good. definitely from the shire. longbottom leaf. i feel like i\\'m back at the green dragon. green dragon. a mug of ale in my hand. putting my feet up on a settle after a hard day\\'s work. only, you\\'ve never done a hard day\\'s work. welcome, my lords  to isengard! you young rascals! a merry hunt you\\'ve led us on  and now we find you feasting and and smoking! we are sitting on a field of victory  enjoying a few well-earned comforts. the salted pork is particularly good. salted pork? hobbits. we\\'re under orders from treebeard  who\\'s taken over management of isengard. young master gandalf. i\\'m glad you\\'ve come. wood and water, stock and stone i can master. but there is a wizard to manage here  locked in his tower. show yourself. be careful. even in defeat, saruman is dangerous. well, let\\'s just have his head and be done with it. no. we need him alive. we need him to talk. you have fought many wars and slain many men, theoden king  and made peace afterwards. can we not take counsel together as we once did, my old friend? can we not have peace, you and i? we shall have peace. we shall have peace  when you answer for the burning of the westfold  and the children that lie dead there! we shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers  whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead  against the gates of the hornburg, are avenged! when you hang from a gibbet for the sport of your own crows  we shall have peace. gibbets and crows? dotard! what do you want, gandalf greyhame? let me guess. the key of orthanc. or perhaps the keys of barad-dur itself  along with the crowns of the seven kings and the rods of the five wizards! your treachery has already cost many lives. thousands more are now at risk. but you could save them, saruman. you were deep in the enemy\\'s counsel. so you have come here for information. i have some for you. something festers in the heart of middle-earth. something that you have failed to see. but the great eye has seen it. even now he presses his advantage. his attack will come soon. you\\'re all going to die. but you know this, don\\'t you, gandalf? you cannot think that this ranger will ever sit upon the throne of gondor. this exile, crept from the shadows, will never be crowned king. gandalf does not hesitate to sacrifice those closest to him  those he professes to love. tell me, what words of comfort did you give the halfling  before you sent him to his doom? the path that you have set him on can only lead to death. i\\'ve heard enough! shoot him. stick an arrow in his gob. no. come down, saruman  and your life will be spared. save your pity and your mercy. i have no use for it! saruman  your staff is broken. grima, you need not follow him. you were not always as you are now. you were once a man of rohan. come down. a man of rohan? what is the house of rohan  but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek  and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs? the victory at helm\\'s deep does not belong to you, theoden horse-master. you are a lesser son of greater sires. grima  come down. be free of him. free? he will never be free. no. get down, cur! saruman! you were deep in the enemy\\'s counsel. tell us what you know! you withdraw your guard, and i will tell you where your doom will be decided. i will not be held prisoner here. send word to all our allies  and to every corner of middle-earth that still stands free. the enemy moves against us. we need to know where he will strike. the filth of saruman  is washing away. trees will come back to live here. young trees. wild trees. pippin! bless my bark! peregrin took! i\\'ll take that, my lad. quickly, now. tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country. hail the victorious dead. hail! no pauses. no spills. and no regurgitation. so it\\'s a drinking game? last one standing wins. what\\'ll we drink to? let\\'s drink to victory! to victory! westu, aragorn, hal. i am happy for you. he is an honorable man. you are both honorable men. it was not theoden of rohan who led our people to victory. ah, don\\'t listen to me. you are young. and tonight is for you. here, here. it\\'s the dwarves that go swimming with little, hairy women. i feel something. a slight tingle in my fingers. i think it\\'s affecting me. what did i say? he can\\'t hold his liquor. game over. oh, you can search far and wide you can drink the whole town dry but you\\'ll never find a beer so brown but you\\'ll never find a beer so brown as the one we drink in our hometown/but you\\'ll never find a beer so brown as the one we drink in our hometown you can drink your fancy ales you can drink them by the flagon but the only brew for the brave and true pippin! but the only brew for the brave and true comes from the green dragon thank you! i win! no news of frodo? no word. nothing. we have time. every day, frodo moves closer to mordor. do we know that? what does your heart tell you? that frodo is alive. yes. yes, he\\'s alive. too risky. too risky. thieves. they stole it from us. kill them. kill them. kill them both. shh! quiet! mustn\\'t wake them. mustn\\'t ruin it now. but they knows. they knows. they suspects us. what\\'s it saying, my precious, my love? is smeagol losing his nerve? no. not. never. smeagol hates nasty hobbitses. smeagol wants to see them dead. and we will. smeagol did it once. he can do it again. it\\'s ours! ours! we must get the precious. we must get it back. patience! patience, my love. first we must lead them to her. we lead them to the winding stair. yes, the stairs. and then? up, up, up, up, up the stairs we go  until we come to the tunnel. and when they go in  there\\'s no coming out. she\\'s always hungry. she always needs to feed. she must eat. all she gets is filthy orcses. and they doesn\\'t taste very nice, does they, precious? no. not very nice at all, my love. she hungers for sweeter meats. hobbit meat. and when she throws away the bones and the empty clothes  then we will find it. and take it for me! for us. yes. we meant ”for us.” gollum. gollum. the precious will be ours  once the hobbitses are dead! you treacherous little toad! no! no! master! no, sam! leave him alone! i heard it from his own mouth. he means to murder us. never! smeagol wouldn\\'t hurt a fly. he\\'s a horrid, fat hobbit  who hates smeagol  and who makes up nasty lies. you miserable little maggot! i\\'ll stove your head in! sam! call me a liar? you\\'re a liar! you scare him off, we\\'re lost! i don\\'t care! i can\\'t do it, mr. frodo. i won\\'t wait around for him to kill us! i\\'m not sending him away. you don\\'t see it, do you? he\\'s a villain. we can\\'t do this by ourselves, sam. not without a guide. i need you on my side. i\\'m on your side, mr. frodo. i know, sam. i know. trust me. come, smeagol. what time is it? not yet dawn. i dreamed i saw a great wave  climbing over green lands and above the hills. i stood upon the brink. it was utterly dark in the abyss before my feet. a light shone behind me  but i could not turn. i could only stand there, waiting. night changes many thoughts. sleep, eowyn. sleep  while you can. the stars are veiled. something stirs in the east. a sleepless malice. the eye of the enemy is moving. what are you doing? pippin! pippin? pippin. are you mad? i just want to look at it. just one more time. put it back. pippin. no! pippin. he is here. i see you. pippin! help! gandalf, help! someone help him! pippin! fool of a took! look at me. gandalf, forgive me. look at me. what did you see? a tree. there was a white tree  in a courtyard of stone. it was dead. the city was burning. minas tirith? is that what you saw? i saw  i saw him. i could hear hisice in my head. and what did you tell him? speak! he asked me my name. i didn\\'t answer. he hurt me. what did you tell him about frodo and the ring? there was no lie in pippin\\'s eyes. a fool  but an honest fool he remains. he told sauron nothing of frodo and the ring. we\\'ve been strangely fortunate. pippin saw in the palantir a glimpse of the enemy\\'s plan. sauron moves to strike the city of minas tirith. his defeat at helm\\'s deep showed our enemy one thing. he knows the heir of elendil has come forth. men are not as weak as he supposed. there is courage still, strength enough perhaps to challenge him. sauron fears this. he will not risk the peoples of middle-earth uniting under one banner. he will raze minas tirith to the ground  before he sees a king return to the throne of men. if the beacons of gondor are lit, rohan must be ready for war. tell me  why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours? what do we owe gondor? i will go. no! they must be warned. they will be. you must come to minas tirith by another road. follow the river. look to the black ships. understand this: things are now in motion that cannot be undone. i ride for minas tirith  and i won\\'t be going alone. of all the inquisitive hobbits, peregrin took, you are the worst. hurry! hurry! where are we going? why did you look? why do you always have to look? i don\\'t know. i can\\'t help it. you never can. i\\'m sorry, all right? i won\\'t do it again. don\\'t you understand? the enemy thinks you have the ring. he\\'s going to be looking for you, pip. they have to get you out of here. and you ? you\\'re coming with me? merry? come on. how far is minas tirith? three days\\' ride, as the nazgul flies. and you better hope we don\\'t have one of those on our tail. here. something for the road. the last of the longbottom leaf. i know you\\'ve run out. you smoke too much, pip. but but we\\'ll see each other soon. won\\'t we? i don\\'t know. i don\\'t know what\\'s going to happen. merry. run, shadowfax. show us the meaning of haste. merry! merry! he\\'s always followed me  everywhere i went  since before we were tweens. i would get him into the worst sort of trouble  but i was always there to get him out. now he\\'s gone. just like frodo and sam. one thing i have learned about hobbits: they\\'re a most hardy folk. foolhardy, maybe. he\\'s a took. take her by the safest road. a ship lies anchored in the grey havens. it waits to carry her across the sea. the last journey of arwen undomiel. there is nothing for you here  only death. lady arwen  we cannot delay. my lady! tell me what you have seen. arwen. you have the gift of foresight. what did you see? i looked into your future, and i saw death. but there is also life. you saw there was a child. you saw my son. that future is almost gone. but it is not lost. nothing is certain. some things are certain. if i leave him now  i will regret it forever. it is time. from the ashes a fire shall be woken a light from the shadow shall spring renewed shall be blade that was broken the crownless again shall be king re-forge the sword. ada. your hands are cold. the life of the eldar is leaving you. this was my choice. ada, whether by your will or not  there is no ship now that can bear me hence. we\\'ve just passed into the realm of gondor. minas tirith. city of kings. make way! it\\'s the tree. gandalf. gandalf. yes, the white tree of gondor. the tree of the king. lord denethor, however, is not king. he is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne. now listen carefully. lord denethor is boromir\\'s father. to give him news of his beloved son\\'s death would be most unwise. and do not mention frodo or the ring. and say nothing of aragorn either. in fact, it\\'s better if you don\\'t speak at all, peregrin took. hail denethor, son of ecthelion, lord and steward of gondor. i come with tidings in this dark hour, and with counsel. perhaps you come to explain this. perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead. boromir died to save us  my kinsman and me. he fell defending us from many foes. pippin. i offer you my service, such as it is  in payment of this debt. this is my first command to you. how did you escape and my son did not  so mighty a man as he was? the mightiest man may be slain by one arrow  and boromir was pierced by many. get up. my lord, there will be a time to grieve for boromir  but it is not now. war is coming. the enemy is on your doorstep. as steward, you are charged  with the defense of this city. where are gondor\\'s armies? you still have friends. you are not alone in this fight. send word to theoden of rohan. light the beacons. you think you are wise, mithrandir. yet for all your subtleties, you have not wisdom. do you think the eyes of the white tower are blind? i have seen more than you know. with your left hand you would use me as a shield against mordor. and with your right you\\'d seek to supplant me. i know who rides with theoden of rohan. oh, yes. word has reached my ears of this aragorn, son of arathorn. and i tell you now, i will not bow to this ranger from the north  last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship. authority is not given to you to deny the return of the king, steward. the rule of gondor is mine and no other\\'s. come. all has turned to vain ambition. he would even use his grief as a cloak. a thousand years this city has stood. now, at the whim of a madman, it will fall. and the white tree, the tree of the king  will never bloom again. why are they still guarding it? they guard it because they have hope. a faint and fading hope that one day it will flower. that a king will come and this city will be as it once was  before it fell into decay. the old wisdom borne out of the west was forsaken. kings made tombs more splendid than the houses of the living  and counted the old names of their descent  dearer than the names of their sons. childless lords sat in aged halls, musing on heraldry  or in high, cold towers, asking questions of the stars. and so the people of gondor fell into ruin. the line of kings failed. the white tree withered. the rule of gondor was given over to lesser men. mordor. yes, there it lies. this city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow. a storm is coming. this is not the weather of the world. this is a device of sauron\\'s making. a broil of fume he sends ahead of his host. the orcs of mordor have no love of daylight  so he covers the face of the sun  to ease their passage along the road to war. when the shadow of mordor reaches this city  it will begin. well  minas tirith  very impressive. so where are we off to next? oh, it\\'s too late for that, peregrin. there\\'s no leaving this city. help must come to us. it must be getting near teatime. leastways, it would be in decent places where there is still teatime. we\\'re not in decent places. mr. frodo? what is it? it\\'s just a feeling. i don\\'t think i\\'ll be coming back. yes, you will. of course you will. that\\'s just morbid thinking. we\\'re going there and back again  just like mr. bilbo. you\\'ll see. i think these lands were once part of the kingdom of gondor. long ago, when there was a king. mr. frodo, look. the king has got a crown again. come on, hobbits! mustn\\'t stop now. this way. so i imagine this is just a ceremonial position. i mean, they don\\'t actually expect me to do any fighting. do they? you\\'re in the service of the steward now. you\\'ll have to do as you\\'re told, peregrin took. ridiculous hobbit. guard of the citadel. thank you. there\\'s no more stars. is it time? yes. it\\'s so quiet. it\\'s the deep breath before the plunge. i don\\'t want to be in a battle  but waiting on the edge of one i can\\'t escape is even worse. is there any hope, gandalf, for frodo and sam? there never was much hope. just a fool\\'s hope. our enemy is ready. his full strength\\'s gathered. not only orcs, but men as well. legions of haradrim from the south  mercenaries from the coast. all will answer mordor\\'s call. come on. this will be the end of gondor as we know it. here the hammer stroke will fall hardest. if the river is taken, if the garrison at osgiliath falls  the last defense of this city will be gone. but we have the white wizard. that\\'s got to count for something. gandalf? sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant  the one who will lead mordor\\'s armies in war. the one they say no living man can kill. the witch king of angmar. you\\'ve met him before. he stabbed frodo on weathertop. he is the lord of the nazgul  the greatest of the nine. minas morgul is his lair. the dead city. very nasty place. full of enemies. quick. quick. they will see. they will see. come away. come away. look, we have found it. the way into mordor. the secret stair. climb. no, mr. frodo! not that way! what\\'s it doing? no. they\\'re calling me. no. hide! hide! i can feel his blade. we come to it at last. the great battle of our time. come away, hobbits. we climb. we must climb. the board is set. the pieces are moving. up, up, up the stairs we go. and then it\\'s into the tunnel. hey, what\\'s in this tunnel? you listen to me, and you listen good and proper. anything happens to him, you have me to answer to. one sniff something\\'s not right  one hair stands up on the back of my head, it\\'s over. no more slinker. no more stinker. you\\'re gone. got it? i\\'m watching you. what was that about? nothing. just clearing something up. peregrin took, my lad, there is a task now to be done. another opportunity for one of the shire-folk to prove their great worth. you must not fail me. it\\'s been very quiet across the river. the orcs are lying low. the garrison may have moved out. we\\'ve sent scouts to cair andros. if the orcs attack from the north, we\\'ll have some warning. quiet. we need 10 more. kill him! they\\'re not coming from the north. to the river. quick. quick. go. come on. faster. draw swords. hold! hold them! what? amon din the beacon. the beacon of amon din is lit. hope is kindled. the beacons of minas tirith! the beacons are lit! gondor calls for aid. and rohan will answer. muster the rohirrim. assemble the army at dunharrow. as many men as can be found. you have two days. on the third, we ride for gondor and war. forward. very good, sir. gamling. my lord. make haste across the riddermark. summon every able-bodied man to dunharrow. i will. will you ride with us? just to the encampment. it\\'s tradition for the women of the court to farewell the men. the men have found their captain. they will follow you into battle, even to death. you have given us hope. excuse me. i have a sword. please accept it. i offer you my service, theoden king. and gladly i accept it. you shall be meriadoc, esquire of rohan. horse-men. i wish i could muster a legion of dwarves, fully armed and filthy. your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war. i fear war already marches on their own lands. so it is before the walls of minas tirith  the doom of our time will be decided. now is the hour. riders of rohan, oaths you have taken. now, fulfill them all. to lord and land! ya! faramir! we can\\'t hold them. the city is lost. tell the men to break cover. we ride for minas tirith. nazgul. take cover! nazgul! fall back. fall back to minas tirith! fall back! retreat! retreat! run for your lives! the age of men is over. the time of the orc has come. keep going. it\\'s the nazgul. take cover, my lord! it\\'s coming! it\\'s mithrandir. the white rider! pull! mithrandir. they broke through our defenses. they\\'ve taken the bridge and the west bank. battalions of orcs are crossing the river. it is as the lord denethor predicted. long has he foreseen this doom. foreseen and done nothing. faramir? this is not the first halfling to have crossed your path. no. you\\'ve seen frodo and sam? where? when? in ithilien. not two days ago. gandalf, they\\'re taking the road to the morgul vale. and then the pass of cirith ungol. what does that mean? what\\'s wrong? faramir, tell me everything. tell me all you know. this is how you would serve your city? you would risk its utter ruin? i did what i judged to be right. what you judged to be right. you sent the ring of power into mordor in the hands of a witless halfling. it should have been brought back to the citadel to be kept safe. hidden. dark and deep in the vaults  not to be used. unless at the uttermost end of need. i would not use the ring. not if minas tirith were falling in ruin and i alone could save her. ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious  as a king of old. boromir would have remembered his father\\'s need. he would have brought me a kingly gift. boromir would not have brought the ring. he would have stretched out his hand to this thing and taken it. he would\\'ve fallen. you know nothing of this matter! he would have kept it for his own. and when he returned  you would not have known your son. boromir was loyal to me! not some wizard\\'s pupil! father? my son. leave me. careful, master. careful. very far to fall. very dangerous are the stairs. come, master. come to smeagol. mr. frodo. get back, you! don\\'t touch him! why does he hates poor smeagol? what has smeagol ever done to him? master? master carries heavy burden. smeagol knows. heavy, heavy burden. fat one cannot know. smeagol look after master. he wants it. he needs it. smeagol sees it in his eye. very soon he will ask you for it. you will see. the fat one will take it from you. send forth all legions. do not stop the attack until the city is taken. slay them all. what of the wizard? i will break him. where are theoden\\'s riders? will rohan\\'s army come? mithrandir. courage is the best defense that you have now. what were you thinking, peregrin took? what service can a hobbit offer such a great lord of men? it was well-done. a generous deed should not be checked with cold counsel. you are to join the tower guard. i didn\\'t think they would find any livery that would fit me. it once belonged to a young boy of the city. a very foolish one  who wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending to his studies. this was yours? yes, it was mine. my father had it made for me. well  i\\'m taller than you were then. though i\\'m not likely to grow anymore, except sideways. never fitted me either. boromir was always the soldier. they were so alike, he and my father. proud. stubborn even. but strong. i think you have strength of a different kind. and one day your father will see it. here do i swear fealty and service to gondor  in peace or war  in living or dying  from  from this hour henceforth  until my lord release me  or death take me. and i shall not forget it  nor fail to reward that which is given. fealty with love. valor with honor. disloyalty with vengeance. i do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defenses  defenses that your brother long held intact. what would you have me do? i will not yield  the river in pelennor unfought. osgiliath must be retaken. my lord, osgiliath is overrun. much must be risked in war. is there a captain here who still has the courage to do his lord\\'s will? you wish now that our places had been exchanged  that i had died and boromir had lived. yes. i wish that. since you were robbed of boromir  i will do what i can in his stead. if i should return, think better of me, father. that will depend on the manner of your return. what are you up to? sneaking off, are we? sneaking? sneaking? fat hobbit is always so polite. smeagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find  and they say “sneak.” sneak? very nice friend. oh, yes, my precious. very nice, very nice. all right. all right! you just startled me is all. what were you doing? sneaking. fine. have it your own way. i\\'m sorry to wake you, mr. frodo. we have to be moving on. it\\'s dark still. it\\'s always dark here. it\\'s gone! the elven bread. what? that\\'s all we have left. he took it. he must have! smeagol? no, no, not poor smeagol. smeagol hates nasty elf bread. you\\'re a lying rat! what did you do with it?! he doesn\\'t eat it. he can\\'t have taken it. look. what\\'s this? crumbs on his jacketses. he took it! he took it. i seen him. he\\'s always stuffing his face when master\\'s not looking. that\\'s a filthy lie! you stinking, two-faced sneak! sam! call me  stop it! sam! i\\'ll kill him! sam! no! oh, my i\\'m sorry. i didn\\'t mean it to go so far. i was just so so angry. here, just let\\'s just rest a bit. i\\'m all right. no. no, you\\'re not all right. you\\'re exhausted. it\\'s that gollum. it\\'s this place. it\\'s that thing around your neck. i could help a bit. i could carry it for a while. carry it for a while. i could carry it i could carry it. share the load share the load the load the load. get away! i don\\'t want to keep it. i just want to help. see? see? he wants it for himself. shut up, you! go away! get out of here! no, sam. it\\'s you. i\\'m sorry, sam. but he\\'s a liar. he\\'s poisoned you against me. you can\\'t help me anymore. you don\\'t mean that. go home. faramir! faramir! your father\\'s will has turned to madness. do not throw away your life so rashly. where does my allegiance lie if not here? this is the city of the men of numenor. i will gladly give my life to defend her beauty  her memory, her wisdom. your father loves you, faramir. he will remember it before the end. can you sing, master hobbit? well  yes. at least, well enough for my own people. but we have no songs for great halls  and evil times. and why should your songs be unfit for my halls? come, sing me a song. home is behind the world ahead and there are many paths to tread through shadow to the edge of night until the stars are all alight mist and shadow cloud and shade all shall fade all shall fade march! march! march! march! march! make way for the king. make way. the king is here. my lord. hail to you, sire. grimbold, how many? i bring 500 men from the westfold, my lord. we have 300 more from fenmarch, theoden king. where are the riders from snowborn? none have come, my lord. six thousand spears. less than half of what i\\'d hoped for. six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of mordor. more will come. every hour lost hastens gondor\\'s defeat. we have till dawn, then we must ride. the horses are restless  and the men are quiet. they grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain. that road there  where does that lead? it is the road to the dimholt, the door under the mountain. none who venture there ever return. that mountain is evil. aragorn. let\\'s find some food. there. a true esquire of rohan. i\\'m ready. sorry. it isn\\'t all that dangerous. it\\'s not even sharp. well, that\\'s no good. you won\\'t kill many orcs with a blunt blade. come on. to the smithy. go! you should not encourage him. you should not doubt him. i do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm. why should merry be left behind? he has as much cause to go to war as you. why can he not fight for those he loves? you know as little of war as that hobbit. when the fear takes him  and the blood and the screams and the horror of battle take hold  do you think he would stand and fight? he would flee. and he would be right to do so. war is the province of men, eowyn. i choose a mortal life. i wish i could\\'ve seen him  one last time. sir? king theoden awaits you, my lord. i take my leave. my lord elrond. i come on behalf of one whom i love. arwen is dying. she will not long survive the evil that now spreads from mordor. the light of the evenstar is failing. as sauron\\'s power grows, her strength wanes. arwen\\'s life is now tied to the fate of the ring. the shadow is upon us, aragorn. the end has come. it will not be our end, but his. you ride to war, but not to victory. sauron\\'s armies march on minas tirith, this you know. but in secret he sends another force which will attack from the river. a fleet of corsair ships sails from the south. they\\'ll be in the city in two days. you\\'re outnumbered, aragorn. you need more men. there are none. there are those who dwell in the mountain. murderers  traitors. you would call upon them to fight? they believe in nothing. they answer to no one. they will answer to the king of gondor. anduril, the flame of the west, forged from the shards of narsil. sauron will not have forgotten the sword of elendil. the blade that was broken shall return to minas tirith. the man who can wield the power of this sword  can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth. put aside the ranger. become who you were born to be. take the dimholt road. i give hope to men. i keep none for myself. why are you doing this? the war lies to the east. you cannot leave on the eve of battle. you cannot abandon the men. eowyn  we need you here. why have you come? do you not know? it is but a shadow and a thought that you love. i cannot give you what you seek. i have wished you joy since first i saw you. just where do you think you\\'re off to? not this time. this time you must stay, gimli. have you learned nothing of the stubbornness of dwarves? you might as well accept it. we\\'re going with you, laddie. what\\'s happening?  where is he going? where\\'s he going? i don\\'t understand. lord aragorn! why does he leave on the eve of battle? he leaves because there is no hope. he leaves because he must. too few have come. we cannot defeat the armies of mordor. no  we cannot. but we will meet them in battle nonetheless. i have left instruction. the people are to follow your rule in my stead. take up my seat in the golden hall. long may you defend edoras  if the battle goes ill. what other duty would you have me do, my lord? duty? no. i would have you smile again  not grieve for those whose time has come. you shall live to see these days renewed  and no more despair. what kind of army would linger in such a place? one that is cursed. long ago, the men of the mountains swore an oath  to the last king of gondor  to come to his aid  to fight. but when the time came  when gondor\\'s need was dire  they fled  vanishing into the darkness of the mountain. and so isildur cursed them  never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge. who shall call them from the grey twilight? the forgotten people. the heir of him to whom the oath they swore. from the north shall he come. need shall drive him. he shall pass the door to the paths of the dead. the very warmth of my blood seems stolen away. the way is shut. it was made by those who are dead. and the dead keep it. the way is shut. brego! i do not fear death. well, this is a thing unheard-of. an elf will go underground where a dwarf dare not? oh. oh, i\\'d never hear the end of it. we must ride light and swift. it is a long road ahead. and man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight. little hobbits do not belong in war, master meriadoc. all my friends have gone to battle. i would be ashamed to be left behind. it is a three-day gallop to minas tirith. and none of my riders can bear you as a burden. i want to fight. i will say no more. ride with me. my lady. form up! move out! form up! move out! ride! ride now to gondor! what is it?

see what? white shores  and beyond. a far green country  under a swift sunrise. well  that isn\\'t so bad. no. no, it isn\\'t. rally to me! to me! feast on his flesh. i will kill you if you touch him. do not come between the nazgul and his prey. late as usual, pirate scum! there\\'s knife-work here needs doing. come on, you sea rats! get off your ships! there\\'s plenty for the both of us. may the best dwarf win. you fool. no man can kill me. die now. i am no man. 15! 16! 17! merry! legolas! 33, 34. that still only counts as one! come on, then. come on! i know your face  eowyn. my eyes darken. no. no. i am going to save you. you already did. eowyn  my body is broken. you have to let me go. i go to my fathers  in whose mighty company  i shall not now feel ashamed. eowyn. release us. bad idea. very handy in a tight spot, these lads, despite the fact they\\'re dead. you gave us your word. i hold your oath fulfilled. go. be at peace. merry. no! no! merry! merry! merry. merry, it\\'s me. it\\'s pippin. i knew you\\'d find me. yes. are you going to leave me? no, merry. i\\'m going to look after you. hands off! that shiny shirt, that\\'s mine. it\\'s going to the great eye, along with everything else. i don\\'t take orders from stinking morgul-rats! you touch it, and i\\'ll stick this blade in your gut. the scum tried to knife me. kill him! that\\'s for frodo! and for the shire! and that\\'s for my old gaffer! stop your squealing, you dunghill rat. i\\'m gonna bleed you like a stuck pig. not if i stick you first. sam! oh, sam, i\\'m so sorry. sorry for everything. let\\'s get you out of here. it\\'s too late. it\\'s over. they\\'ve taken it. sam  they took the ring. begging your pardon, but they haven\\'t. i thought i\\'d lost you. so i took it. only for safekeeping. give it to me. give me the ring, sam. sam. give me the ring. you must understand. the ring is my burden. it will destroy you, sam. come on, mr. frodo. we best find you some clothes. you can\\'t go walking through mordor in naught but your skin. we did it, mr. frodo. we made it to mordor. there are so many of them. we\\'ll never get through unseen. it\\'s him, the eye. we have to go in there, mr. frodo. there\\'s nothing for it. come on. let\\'s just make it down the hill for starters. frodo has passed beyond my sight. the darkness is deepening. if sauron had the ring, we would know it. it\\'s only a matter of time. he has suffered a defeat, yes but  behind the walls of mordor, our enemy is regrouping. let him stay there. let him rot! why should we care? because 10,000 orcs now stand between frodo and mount doom. i\\'ve sent him to his death. no. there is still hope for frodo. he needs time and safe passage across the plains of gorgoroth. we can give him that. how? draw out sauron\\'s armies. empty his lands. then we gather our full strength and march on the black gate. we cannot achieve victory through strength of arms. not for ourselves. but we can give frodo his chance if we keep sauron\\'s eye fixed upon us. keep him blind to all else that moves. a diversion. certainty of death  small chance of success  what are we waiting for? sauron will suspect a trap. he will not take the bait. oh, i think he will. long have you hunted me. long have i eluded you. no more. behold the sword of elendil. the city has fallen silent. there is no warmth left in the sun. it grows so cold. it\\'s just the damp of the first spring rain. i do not believe this darkness will endure. look, the orcs  they\\'re moving off. you see, mr. frodo  some luck at last. move it, you slugs! come on! faster! come along, you coldhearted wretched scum  i\\'ll whip you down to the bone, you  come on! what have i told you? no evasion. now move it! get up! come on, you slugs! you two are going straight to the front line! now, move it! go on! fall in! move it! move it! move it! to the gate, you slugs! now, move it! faster! don\\'t you know we\\'re at war? company, halt! inspection! sam, help me. mr. frodo! stand up, mr. frodo. stand up! it\\'s so heavy. oh, no. what do i do? what do we do? hit me. what? hit me, sam. start fighting. get off of me! nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot. get off of me! break it up! break it up! oi! i\\'ll have your guts if you don\\'t shut this rabble down! go, sam. now! move along, scum! back in the line! you maggots! get back into the line, you slugs! dig it, you slugs. move it. i can\\'t  i can\\'t i can\\'t manage the ring, sam. it\\'s it\\'s  it\\'s such a weight to carry. it\\'s  such a weight. we\\'re going that way. straight as we can. there\\'s no point carrying anything we\\'re not sure to need. mr. frodo. look. there is light  and beauty up there  that no shadow can touch. take mine. there\\'s a few drops left. there will be none left for the return journey. i don\\'t think there will be a return journey, mr. frodo. frodo, get down! hide! frodo! where are they? let the lord of the black land come forth! let justice be done upon him! my master, sauron the great, bids thee welcome. is there any in this rout with authority to treat with me? we do not come to treat with sauron  faithless and accursed. tell your master this: the armies of mordor must disband. he is to depart these lands, never to return. old greybeard. i have a token i was bidden to show thee. frodo. frodo. silence. no! silence! the halfling was dear to thee, i see. know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host. who would\\'ve thought one so small could endure so much pain? and he did, gandalf. he did. and who is this? isildur\\'s heir? it takes more to make a king than a broken elvish blade. i guess that concludes negotiations. i do not believe it. i will not. pull back. pull back! it\\'s gone, mr. frodo. the light\\'s passed on, away towards the north. something\\'s drawn its gaze. hold your ground! hold your ground. sons of gondor, of rohan, my brothers! i see in your eyes  the same fear that would take the heart of me. a day may come when the courage of men fails  when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship. but it is not this day. an hour of wolves and shattered shields  when the age of men comes crashing down. but it is not this day. this day we fight! by all that you hold dear on this good earth  i bid you stand, men of the west! never thought i\\'d die fighting side by side with an elf. what about side by side with a friend? aye. i could do that. do you remember the shire, mr. frodo? it\\'ll be spring soon. and the orchards will be in blossom. and the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket. and they\\'ll be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields  and eating the first of the strawberries with cream. do you remember the taste of strawberries? no, sam. i can\\'t recall the taste of food  nor the sound of water  nor the touch of grass. i\\'m  naked in the dark. there\\'s there\\'s nothing. no veil between me and the wheel of fire. i can see him  with my waking eyes. then let us be rid of it  once and for all. come on, mr. frodo. i can\\'t carry it for you  but i can carry you. come on! aragorn. elessar. for frodo. look, mr. frodo. a doorway. we\\'re almost there. clever hobbits to climb so high! mustn\\'t go that way. mustn\\'t hurt the precious. you swore! you swore on the precious! smeagol promised! smeagol lied. frodo! eagles. the eagles are coming! frodo! i\\'m here, sam. destroy it! go on! now! throw it in the fire! what are you waiting for? just let it go! the ring is mine. no. no. no! yes! yes! precious! precious! precious! precious! give me your hand! take my hand! no! don\\'t you let go. don\\'t let go. reach! frodo! frodo! it\\'s gone. it\\'s done. yes, mr. frodo. it\\'s over now. i can see the shire. the brandywine river. bag end. gandalf\\'s fireworks. the lights in the party tree. rosie cotton dancing. she had ribbons in her hair. if ever i was to marry someone  it would\\'ve been her. it would\\'ve been her. i\\'m glad to be with you, samwise gamgee  here at the end of all things. gandalf? frodo! gimli! now come the days of the king. may they be blessed. this day does not belong to one man  but to all. let us together rebuild this world  that we may share in the days of peace. out of the great sea  to middle-earth i am come. in this place will i abide  and my heirs  unto the ending of the world. thank you. my friends  you bow to no one. and thus it was. a fourth age of middle-earth began. and the fellowship of the ring  though eternally bound by friendship and love  was ended. thirteen months to the day since gandalf sent us on our long journey  we found ourselves looking upon a familiar sight. we were home. hi. hey, watch the pumpkin. more of the same, rosie. good night, lads. how do you pick up the threads of an old life? how do you go on  when in your heart you begin to understand  there is no going back? there are some things that time cannot mend  some hurts that go too deep  that have taken hold. mr. frodo? what is it? it\\'s been four years to the day since weathertop, sam. it\\'s never really healed. “there and back again. a hobbit\\'s tale by bilbo baggins. and the lord of the rings by frodo baggins.\" you finished it. not quite. there\\'s room for a little more. bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end  that each of us must come and go in the telling. bilbo\\'s story was now over. there would be no more journeys for him  save one. tell me again, lad, where are we going? to the harbor, bilbo. the elves have accorded you a special honor  a place on the last ship to leave middle-earth. frodo  any chance of seeing that old ring of mine again? the one i gave you. i\\'m sorry, uncle. i\\'m afraid i lost it. oh. pity. i should like to have held it one last time. well, here\\'s a sight i have never seen before. the power of the three rings is ended. the time has come  for the dominion of men. the sea calls us home. i think i\\'m  quite ready for another adventure. farewell  my brave hobbits. my work is now finished. here at last, on the shores of the sea  comes the end of our fellowship. i will not say, “do not weep”  for not all tears are an evil. it is time, frodo. what does he mean? we set out to save the shire, sam. and it has been saved. but not for me. you don\\'t mean that. you can\\'t leave. the last pages are for you, sam. my dear sam: you cannot always be torn in two. you will have to be one and whole for many years. you have so much to enjoy and to be and to do. your part in the story will go on. well  i\\'m back.'"

       "'black continues elvish singing a woman\\'s voice is whispering, tinged with sadness and regret flickering firelight. the noldorin forge in eregion. molten gold pours from the lip of an iron ladle. three rings, each set with a single gem, are received by the high elves-galadriel, gil-galad and cirdan. seven rings held aloft in triumph by the dwarf lords. nine rings clutched tightly by the kings of men as if holding-close a precious secret. an ancient parchment map of middle earth moving slowly across the map as if drawn by an unseen force the camera closes in on a place name mordor. sauron forging the one ring in the chambers of sammath naur. the one ring falls through space and into flames. a great shadow falls across the map closing in around the realm of gondor. screaming villagers, men, women, and children, run from their homes, pursued by armies of hideous orcs. the battle of dagorlad the elf lord, elrond, commands rank after rank of elven archers orcs retreating before the army of the last alliance elendil holds aloft the great sword narsil. the huge, dark figure of saruron, bearing the one ring on his finger, looms over the field of battle. sauron lays waste to the armies of the last alliance. with desperate courage, elendil leads a charge the black mace of sauron lashes out elendil\\'s body falls like a crumpled rag doll isildur cradles the body of his father in his arms. the shadow of sauron falls over him. isildur snatches up the broken blade of narsil the blade severs sauron\\'s fingers and the one ring flies from his body. gone vaporized. isildur picks up the severed finger and removes the one ring transfixed. suddenly. arrows fly. they are ambushed by orcs isildur screams. isildur materializes under water as the ring slips slowly from his finger. ripples of light play across isildur\\'s pale face he is dead. the ring falls through the murky waters of the river anduin. the waters of the anduin river lie dark and undisturbed. silt swirls a thin white hand reaches down grasping the ring. the thin white hand opens to reveal one ring. mist shrouded mountains. the gloom of a mountain cavern a murky pool of water in the darkness the shadowy outline of an emaciated figure. bathed in cold moonlight, the world lies dark and still the unsettled quiet before the storm. unseen by its keeper the ring falls to the muddy floor of a mountain tunnel. fumbling in the dark, a small hand closes over the ring. a youngish looking bilbo baggins peers down at what lies in his hand perplexed by what he has found. suddenly. a voice screams its anguish ringing through the cold, dank tunnels. frightened bilbo quickly pockets the one ring and hurries on. the camera soars away from the mountains. moving faster and faster their dark green forests and jagged white peaks receding into the shroud of mist two hobbit feet resting on a small rock rising out of the long, overgrown grasses a figure lies beneath the dappled sunlight of an old tree. white flowers are scattered among the well seeded grasses. an idyllic setting at the end of a long hot summer the figure is reading a book. in the distance, growing louder over the gentle clip clop of an approaching cart and horse can be heard the humming of a deep voice to the tune of \"the road goes ever on and on \" suddenly. the figure in the grass sits up looking straight at camera is a handsome young hobbit, with dark curly hair and deep blue eyes. this is frodo baggins his eyes alight with excitement. tossing away the long stem of grass in his mouth, frodo runs off. the cart rattles along a leafy lane, driven by a stooped figure in grey. intercut with shots of frodo running careering down a hill jumping over logs dodging tree branches. the shambling old pony snorts and rears as suddenly frodo appears on a bank above the cart. gandalf glowers at the young hobbit. they look at each other a moment then both start laughing as frodo\\'s face breaks into a smile and he leaps on to the front seat of the cart. next to gandalf, we see how small hobbits are frodo is 3 foot 6 inches tall. the cart rattles past a field lupin being tended by hobbits. gandalf looks down at frodo, a twinkle in his eye. the cart rattles over a stone bridge towards a busy hobbit marketplace. gandalf as he surveys the peaceful scene before him. hobbits look up exclaiming in wonder and excitement as the cart bearing gandalf and frodo rolls past the green dragon inn towards the party field. where scorcs of hobbits are busy preparing for the big night. frodo shoots a knowing look, as gandalf averts his eyes. odo proudfoot looks up as the cart passes by, deeply suspicious. as the cart rattles into the small village of hobbiton a quaint rustic settlement, nestled amongst rolling green hills and large trees. the hobbits live in hobbit holes neat burrows dug into the grassy hillside, with round doors and cute front gardens. excited children, chasing after the cart. gandalf ignorcs the children\\'s cries. the children stand deflated, watching gandalf disappear up the lane. at that moment spinning balls of bright color suddenly leap out of the cart, fizzing over the heads of the delighted children. gandalf smiling to himself, well pleased with his joke. odo proudfoot is unable to suppress a chuckle. frodo stands up in the cart as gandalf reigns in the horse. gandalf\\'s cart pulls up outside the gate to bag end a particularly fine example of a hobbit hole, with a large round front door set into a grassy hillside. there is a sign on the gate which reads \"no admittance except on party business.\" gandalf strides up to the garden path of bag end. he raises his staff and raps on the front door a voice calls out suddenly the door opens and bilbo baggins stands before him. he is a hobbit of indertiminate age, with a mischievous twinkle in his eye. wearing a dashing brocade waist coat, he looks every inch the eccentric gentleman. gandalf drops to his knee to embrace his old friend. gandalf looks at him more keenly. bilbo leads gandalf into bag end cozy and cluttered with souvenirs of bilbo\\'s travels. gandalf has to stoop to avoid hitting his head on the low ceiling. bilbo hangs up gandalf\\'s hat on a peg and trots off down the hall. bilbo disappears into the kitchen as gandalf looks around enjoying the familiarity of bag end he turns, knocking his head on the light and then walking into the wooden beam. he groans. gandalf stops in front of a framed map, charred in one corner it is thorin\\'s map of the lonely mountain, gandalf smiles to himself. bilbo jumps, a half eaten pork pie in his hand, as gandalf mysteriously appears behind him. bilbo baggins, you open this door i know you\\'re in there. gandalf watches, amused as bilbo tries to hide. bilbo\\'s fingers close around his waistcoat pocket gripping a small, unseen object. gandalf and bilbo are sitting on the bag end porch. below them, final preparations are being made on the party field. bilbo strikes a match and lights his pipe. bilbo blows a perfect smoke ring and watches it rise into the air. a tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through the center of bilbo\\'s smoke ring. boom. a firework explodes into the night sky high above hobbiton in the shape of a great green tree with unfolding branches. with glowing flowers as they rain down from the branches evaporating just above the up turned faces of the delighted party-goers 144 hobbits, feasting and drinking carts of beer and wine are scattered about, and the tables are piled high with steaming scones and savories. gandalf hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark that dances magically from his staff bilbo is greeting visitors. frodo and sam sit at a table drinking ale frodo notices sam\\'s eyes keep flicking to another pretty hobbit, rosie cotton, sitting some distance away. sam goes to drain his glass suddenly it is snatched out of his hands as frodo thrusts him into the middle of a passing throng of dancers. sam\\'s horrified face as he is swept away. frodo laughs and finishes sam\\'s beer. gandalf as he sets alight a particularly spectacular firework that draws gasps of admiration from the party guests. bilbo is relating stories of his adventure to a group of young hobbit children. a little hobbit girl\\'s upturned face her eyes growing larger and larger. stunned gasps from his young audience greet his astonishing feat. merry and pippin, two mischievous young hobbits in their late teens. pippin scrambles on to the back of gandalf\\'s wagon, snatching up a small firework merry is holding out the big rocket he looks aghast at the fizzing fuse that pippin has just lit. merry fearfully tosses the rocket to pippin. the fuse sizzles angrily. pippin attempts to throw the fizzing rocket back to merry. whoosh. the two hobbits are suddenly blown off their feet in a shower of sparks as the rocket blasts off with frightening power. the rocket zooms over the party it suddenly bursts apart, forming the shape of a great red golden dragon. fire gushes from its nostrils as it turns back and flies low towards the startled crowd. frodo watches the fireworks dragon with alarm but bilbo is oblivious to the panicking crowd and impending danger. frodo as he hurriedly pulls bilbo to the ground, just as the dragon roars a few feet above their heads like a flaming express train. hobbits dive to the ground, tables overturn, tents collapse, food flies everywhere. the fireworks dragon turns a somersault and explodes over the hills with a deafening bang. this gets the biggest cheer of the night. merry and pippin, clothes and hair smoking. large hands suddenly clamp down on merry and pippin\\'s ears. gandalf looking down sternly. merry and pippin are leaning over a barrel, washing dishes in soapy water with gandalf sitting nearby, smoking his pipe and sipping an ale. cries of \"speech. speech\" erupt from the party. bilbo stepping on a stool he bows in gratitude at the applause. a hobbit with particularly big feet scattered clapping as the guests try to work out if that was a compliment or not. frodo and gandalf smiling to themselves. bilbo a strange hum seems to fill his head. a bead of sweat rolls down his brow. bilbo\\'s hand pulls something out of his waistcoat pocket and holds it behind his back. bilbo instantly vanishes. the party explodes into an uproar the crowd leaps to its feet. frodo staring at the empty stool in disbelief. the party is still in an excited uproar some 50 yards away as we pan across a moonlit lane to the front door of bag end. door opens, pulled by an invisible hand. the door quietly closes bilbo materializes as he pulls a plain gold ring off his finger. bilbo laughs as he tosses the ring in the air, then places it in his pocket. bilbo emerges from the passage, carrying a walking stick. he finds gandalf looming over him. bilbo he gives gandalf a look and nods toward the mantelpiece. gandalf looks down at bilbo with rising concern. gandalf rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadow suddenly seems to fill the room bilbo lifts his knapsack and heads for the front door. bilbo hesitates reaches into his pocket. bilbo pulls out the ring he stares at it in his palm. with all his will power, bilbo allows the ring to slowly slide off his palm and drop to the floor. the tiny ring lands with a heavy thud on the wooden floor. bilbo staggering out of bag end he braces himself in the night air, pale and trembling, as if his loss of the ring has weakened him. gandalf steps up behind. bilbo walks away from bag end, disappearing into the night, softly singing \"the road goes on and on.\" the ring glinting on the floor gandalf circles around it, a puzzled look on his face. gandalf slowly reaches for the ring. his fingers barely touch the ring the creepy hum rises on the soundtrack. gandalf is sitting in front of the fire, with his pipe staring into the flickering flames. frodo rushes into bag end he stops and picks up the ring at his feet. gandalf continues staring into the fire, as if locked in thought. gandalf turns his eyes locking onto the ring

moonlight. paranoia blazes in his eyes. his clothes are dirty and ragged from much traveling. hair and beard much longer an unkempt. frodo pulls the envelope out of an old chest. gandalf, suspicious, alert. without a word, gandalf takes the envelope and tosses it into the fireplace. flames instantly consume the envelope revealing the ring, as it sinks into the red hot embers. gandalf reaches into the fire with a pair of tongs he lifts the ring out. gandalf drops the ring into frodo\\'s hand he reacts to its weight. gandalf still tense mordor? in the common tongue it says, \"one ring to rule

continue their journey. gandalf is galloping along the outskirts of the ancient forest of fangorn. nestled in a basin at the foot of the distant misty mountains, the tall black tower of orthanc is clearly visible gandalf gallops through the gate, into the fortress of isengard a great ring-wall of stone, a mile from rim to rim, encloses beautiful trees and gardens, watered by streams that flow down from the mountains. the strange tower of orthanc hewn from a solid pillar of black obsidian rises up in the center of the isengard circle. gandalf arrives at the foot of the orthanc stairs. saruman, the white wizard he sweeps down the orthanc stairs. gandalf moves quickly towards him, grimy and weary from his long ride. gandalf and saruman walk slowly between the beautiful trees of isengard, saruman\\'s clean, white robe contrasts with gandalf\\'s dusty grey robes. saruman and gandalf are seated in a small, cluttered room to the side of the cavernous central chamber. gandalf and saruman stride through orthanc toward a stone plinth on which a sphere like shape is draped with a cloth. saruman lifts the cloth to reveal the palantir. flash a fiery eye. saruman sits upon his throne. gandalf backs away and turns to run to the door horrified as the doors suddenly slam shut. gandalf slowly turns to saruman a look of dawning horror. at that moment gandalf is suddenly blasted across the room. he slams against the wall pinned there by some unseen force. with sudden effort, gandalf wrenches himself off the wall and swings his staff on saruman blasting him off his feet. gandalf and saruman battle, powerful blasts throwing them across the room. saruman screams, eyes blazing. gandalf\\'s staff is suddenly wrenched from his grasp it flies across the chamber into saruman\\'s hand. gandalf is flung to the floor. gandalf is breathing hard on the floor, his eyes look into the madness of saruman commanding two staffs, saruman sends gandalf into a sickening spin. gandalf tumbles towards the top of the chamber as if falling in reverse. the roof of orthanc rockets toward camera. frodo and sam walking along a country lane which borders farmer maggot\\'s fields. sam is looking up frodo has disappeared around a corner in the lane. merry, pippin, and frodo picking themselves up a variety of vegetables have scattered everywhere. merry gives sam a large cabbage. a large pitchfork can be seen racing towards them along the hedgerow angry shouts from farmer maggot. merry and pippin hurriedly gather their booty and race away with frodo and sam on their heels. the baying of large dogs sounds. frodo, sam, and merry and pippin tumble head over heels down a bank, onto a dark, wooded road. a winded pippin, his face inches away from a large pile of horse droppings. frodo picks himself up and looks around quickly. pulls a large carrot, almost broken through in the middle, out from his back pocket. pippin has spied something under the trees on the far side of the road. small, brown mushrooms growing amongst the loamy undergrowth. sam, merry, and pippin race toward the mushrooms. frodo is tense and watchful. he realizes they are on a wooded road. scattered leaves rise into the air whirling down the road as if blown by an invisible wind. suddenly the sound of horses hooves. a long drawn wail comes down the wind, like the cry of some evil and lonely creature. sam grabs merry and pippin as the hobbits quickly scramble down the bank, hiding under a mossy log. the sound of hooves is close a sinister mounted ringwrath steps into view hooded and faceless, mounted on a huge snarling black horse with insane eyes . frodo freezes in terror. the ringwraith pauses right beside their hiding place he sits very still with his head bowed, listening. from inside the hood comes a sniffing noise as if he is trying to catch an elusive scent his head turning from side to side. frodo beads of sweat gather on his brow. the ringwraith suddenly slides off his horse, leaning over the mossy log, peering suspiciously into the woods. frodo he is drawing the ring out of his pocket, with trembling hands his face fevered and sweating as if in the grip of some terrible internal struggle. the sound of sniffing intensifies as the ringwraith darts his head from side to side like a bird of party. frodo squeezing his eyes shut. quick psychic blasts. and evil dark tower a great eye a burst of flame. sam looking at frodo with concern merry desperately hurls the mushrooms across the road the ringwraith spins around at the sound, and darts to the far side of the road with frightening speed. frodo instantly slumps as if a psychic link had been broken frodo is staring, a look of shock on his face at the ring lying in the palm of his hand. frodo, sam, merry, and pippin hurry through the trees slipping and sliding on the muddy ground. merry moves past pippin, toward frodo, watching intently sam keeps looking around nervously. the silhouette of a black rider looms against the skyline. the four hobbits sprawled on the ground, holding their breath. the black rider turns and departs. merry looks at his friend realizing frodo is in deep trouble. the

river and the ferry. stomping hooves snarling horses. four ringwraiths are speeding through the fog converging on the ferry crossing. the hobbits stampede across the wharf and tumble onto the ferry. frodo races across the wooden wharf, followed by the ringwraiths. he leaps into the ferry. hooves thunder down the wooden wharf. sam and merry shove off with the poles the ferry slides out into the river, just as the ringwraiths arrive. they pull up on the end of the wharf shrieking with rage. the hobbits cover their ears. the ringwraiths wheel their horses towards the north and gallop away along the river bank, quickly disappearing into the fog. lights of bree a small village of stone and half timbered houses nestled against a low wooded hill. a thick hedge surrounds the village a great gate bars the western entrance. frodo, sam, merry and pippin approaching the gatehouse wild eyes, ragged, and out of breath. a surly gatekeeper glances down at them. the gatekeeper swings his lantern onto the hobbits, bathing them in an uncomfortable yellow spotlight. the hobbits gratefully enter bree the gatekeeper eyeing them curiously in the lantern light. the tall bree folk loom over the nervous little hobbits as frodo, sam, merry and pippin make their way through the narrow streets. tall buildings tower above them lights glow dimly from behind thick curtains. the sign of the \"prancing pony inn\" frodo, sam, merry, and pippin hurry toward it. frodo, sam, merry and pippin come rushing in. frodo attracts the inn keepers\\'s attention. the noise, smokey inn. it is dimly lit, cheifly from a blazing log fire and crowded with a mixture of big folk, local hobbits, and a couple of dwarfs. frodo, sam, merry and pippin are sitting at a table against the wall clearly trying to remain quiet and inconspicuous sam can\\'t help himself he keeps casting nervous glances around. merry ploinks himself down at a table, carrying a very large mug of beer. sam watches pippin rise unsteadily to his feet and head to the bar. a couple of swarthy men leaning against the bar glance at frodo, then quickly look away. sam indicates a brooding stranger who sits alone at a table in the far corner, smoking a curiously carved long stemmed pipe, peering from beneath a travel stained cowl with gleaming eyes. frodo gestures to butterbur. beneath table frodo\\'s fingers are nervously toying with the ring. frodo sweat runs down his brow. the strange hum of the ring spills into the soundtrack. baggins baggins  a creepy whisper seems to fill frodo\\'s head sound that dissolves into pippin\\'s loud voice pippin sitting at the bar, chatting with locals. frodo leaps to his feet and pushes his way towards the bar. frodo grabs pippin\\'s sleeve, spilling his beer. pippin pushes frodo away he stumbles backwards, and falls to the floor. at that instant, the inn goes silent and all the attention turns to frodo. the ring in agonizing slow motion we watch as it seems to hang in the air for a split second then crashes down onto his out stretched finger. frodo vanishes. there is a sharp intake of breath followed by total silence. the ringwraiths turn sharply in their saddles instantly aware that the ring is being worn. they spur their horses towards the distant lights of bree. sam looks sick pippin instantly sobers, realizing his folly the brooding stranger frowns and the inn erupts into excited babble. frodo as he finds himself in the twilight world of the ring the excited crowd are suddenly moving in slow motion distorted voices a weird photographic negative quality. frodo is moving in real time against the slow motion background. he suddenly clutches his head as he is hit with quick images of a great eye. an evil cat-like eye, wreathed in flames. voice of sauron there is no life here in the void only cold only death frodo is terrified. he rolls under a table, desperately pulling the ring from his finger. frodo materializes into the real world. at that moment

hobbit\\'s room by strider. the door bursts open and sam, merry and pippin appear on the doorway. sam is squaring off with is fists, merry brandishes a candlestick, and pippin a chair. strider sheaths

swords above the sleeping hobbits. sam\\'s eyes open wide. in unison, the ringwraits stab the hobbits, in a slashing, hacking frenzy. strider is grimly listening to the sounds from his room. the ringwraiths step back from the slashed beds in triumph. a hacked blanket is pulled back to reveal nothing but a shredded pillow. the ringwraiths shriek with rage sam sits up with a start. another shredded pillow is revealed. more shrieks of rage. pippin and merry wake with a start. sam, merry, and pippin have been sleeping on strider\\'s bed. frodo stands next to strider by the window, peering out nervously as furious ringwraith screeches echo across the courtyard from the hobbits room. strider looks from the window as the ringwraiths gallop down the bree streets. strider turns back to the hobbits, his face lit faintly by the glowing embers of the fire. strider, merry, pippin, and frodo march through a gloomy, overgrown forest. sam follows at the read leading \"bill\", a scrawny pony,

to merry, who deftly catches it. another, aimed at pippin, catches him on the forehead. the hobbits trudge through rain, looking tired, hungry, and miserable. saruman stands over the palantir, his hands cupping the massive eye. black speech fills the room admist the harsh, guttural words the voice of saruman emerges. saruman is seated as his orc overseer approaches. gandalf lying unconscious on a cold obsidian floor. he wakes to the sound of ripping and tearing rising onto his knees lifting his head gandalf stands as the camera pulls back to reveal him stranded on the summit of orthanc. he is marooned on the tiny, flat peak, surrounded on all sides by a sheer 500 foot drop. another whispering wail rends the air. gandalf crosses quickly to the edge and peers down one of the beautiful isengard trees is being ripped from the ground by the orcs. gandalf looks on in horror as orcs hack into the trunk with axes. more and more trees are hauled down and killed as gandalf looks on in

unable to resist any longer, falls to his knees and slips on the ring. he disappears. frodo finds himself in the weird twilight world he looks upon the ringwraiths, now visible in their true appearance five ghouls dressed in long grey robes, with white hair, and pallid, ruthless faces. the witch king extends a haggard hand towards frodo, reaching for the ring on his finger. frodo\\'s trembling hand extends forward as if by the pull of the ring he slides to the ground, unable to pull his hand away. the witch king snarls and springs forward. he stabs at frodo with a wicked dagger. frodo winces as the tip of the dagger sinks into his shoulder. suddenly, strider charges at the ringwraiths, wielding his sword in one hand, a flaming torch in the other. he moves in slow motion, visible through a sea of mist. frodo sinks to the ground. behind him is a faint image of a ringwraith fleeing, his head engulfed in flames. with draining strength, frodo manages to pull the ring off his finger.  appearing back in the real world, sam rushes over to him. another ringwraith is burning and screaming others screech fearfully at the flames, turn and flee form the weathertop summit.

from deep underground. the camera is rising a small moth flutters into shot and leads the camera towards the summit or orthanc. gandalf lies slumped against the wall at the very top of orthanc, surrounded by a sheer 500 foot drop. he looks weak and frail and is seemingly asleep. the moth flutters close to gandalf. his hand suddenly moves at lighting speed and snatches the moth. gandalf brings his hand close to his face and opens it. the moth sits on the palm of his hand as gandalf mutter strange words in a foreign tongue. the moth\\'s face seemingly listening. it suddenly flutters away. camera follows the moth off the orthanc summit, but drops past the moth falling down, down, towards the pitted wasteland, straight into a fiery red tunnel. the dead trees of isengard are fed

silver running through the stone. a large moon rises over the mountains the lines grow broader and clearer, forming a glowing arch of interlacing ancient letters and symbols. gandalf raises his arms. the cliff towers into the night, the wind blows cold, frodo shivers and the door stands fast. gandalf continues. mumbling spells in his efforts to open the door. sam packs pots and pans at his feet watching sadly as aragorn un- saddles bill the pony. aragorn whispering to bill the pony. splash. merry and pippin are tossing stones into the lake. black rippling rings slowly fan out. pippin is about to throw another stone, but aragorn grabs his arm. aragorn watches anxiously as the ripples appear to grow he exchanges a look with boromir. aragorn\\'s hand creeps towards his sword. gandalf gives up in despair he sits down beside frodo. frodo peers at the elvish inscription his face breaks into a smile of comprehension. gandalf raises his eyebrows. with that, the rock face silently divides in the middle and two great doors swing outwards revealing a blackness deeper than the night. as the fellowship enter the blackness, something in the water stirs. the fellowship step warily into the darkness of moria a dank cavern, with winding steps leading deeper into the mountain. a glow from gandalf\\'s staff suddenly lights the chamber the fellowship recoil in horror. many dwarf skeletons are strewn about, clearly the dead of some old battle the rusting armor and shields are peppered with arrows and axes. the fellowship draw swords and back away, towards the entrance. frodo is suddenly pulled to the ground. a long sinuous tentacle is wrapped around frodo\\'s ankle and is dragging him towards the lake. frodo cries out as aragorn and boromir rush forward. aragorn severs the tentacle holding frodo, and pulls him to safety boromir hacks at the other writhing limbs. 20 more tentacles ripple out of the lake. the dark water boils as the hideous beast lashes out at the fellowship. again the creature grabs frodo and pulls him to the lake, frodo is flung in the air as the fellowship battle the creature. aragorn hacks at a tentacle frodo is released, falling into boromir\\'s arms. legolas shoots an arrow into the creature\\'s head, gaining a few vital seconds for aragorn and boromir as they race out of the water with frodo. the fellowship hurriedly back away from the creature retreating into the moria chamber as many coiling arms seize the large doors. with a shattering echo, the creature rips the doors away, creating a rock slide that crashes down the cliff face. within seconds, tons of rock seal the doorway throwing the fellowship into pitch blackness. the fellowship crossing a precarious bridge above deep mine workings. they continue up a steep stair, passing through a dwarf cemetery. the graves are despoiled dwarf skeletons are strewn about and goblin graffiti is scrawled on monuments in dried dwarf blood. the atmosphere is very sinister. the path splits into three passages each disappearing into dark tunnels. gandalf pauses, frowning. later the fellowship are nervously waiting while gandalf sits, staring intently at the 3 tunnel mouths in front of him. he appears to be in some kind of trance. frodo he turns at the sound of a faint noise down the tunnel behind them. a sudden glimpse of a creature darting in the darkness. frodo is nervous he approaches gandalf. teasing shot and emaciated, leering creature. gollum\\'s withered fingers are gripping the cave wall he is large, luminous eyes blinking with malice. the fellowship pass under an arched doorway into a black and empty space. gandalf pauses. blazes like a silent flash of lightning. great shadows spring up and flee. their heads, upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone. before them stretches a huge empty hall, with black walls, polished and smooth as glass. ahead of them, a wooden door has been smashed. black arrows are embedded in the timbers. two goblin skeletons lie in the doorway. gimli rushes ahead. gimli rushes into another vast empty chamber lit with a narrow shaft of sunlight, beaming in from a small hole near the roof. dwarf and goblin skeletons are piled high. in the far corner sits a stone walled well. a shaft of light falls directly onto a stone table in the middle of the room a single oblong block, about 4 feet high, topped with a great slab of white stone. gimli falls to his knees. gimli sobs. gandalf quietly reads an inscription of runes, carved onto the white stone slab. gandalf carefully lifts the rotting remains of a book from the white stone slab. it has been slashed and stabbed and appears to be covered in dried blood. the pages crack and break as he opens it. unnerved, pippin backs away nervously he stumbles against the well, sending a precariously balanced armored skeleton tumbling in. merry reaches out, grabbing hold of pippin before he falls. the fellowship freeze in stunned silence as the armored skeleton clatters down the deep well echoing loudly. gandalf turns angrily on pippin. pippin, chastened. they fall silent. a low rolling boom rises from the depths below growing louder boom boom as if the caverns of moria were turned into a vast drum. a great horn blasts nearby answering horns running feet harsh cries sam\\'s eyes glance at frodo\\'s belt. aragorn and boromir slam and wedge the doors. boromir catches sight of something he turns to aragorn with shock in his eyes. gimli snatches up two rusty dwarf axes and leaps onto the tomb. boom. the door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments, and 20 goblins charge into the tomb, followed by a huge cave troll. gimli ducks a blow and immediately buries his axes in 2 goblin helmets. aragorn and boromir wade into the mass of goblins with their swords. legolas fires deadly arrows into goblin throats, desperately trying to shield the hobbits. gandalf is clutching his sword and joins in the battle. the cave troll is sweeping his club at aragorn who stumbles backwards the huge club descends for the killing blow suddenly, in a flash of steel, boromir\\'s long sword slices into the scaly arm of the troll it rears back, spewing green blood. sam is backing up against a wall a sword in one hand, a saucepan in the other. in desperation he swings wildly at a goblin with a saucepan. it keels over sam looks surprised. he wallops another goblin and it too, drops. the cave troll lunges forward, thrusting at frodo\\'s chest with his spear. the hobbits go crazy. sam slashes at the cave troll\\'s knee, bringing him down merry and pippin jump on him legolas fires an arrow and the cave troll topples, dead. aragorn rushes to frodo\\'s side as he slumps to the floor frodo appears to be dead. gandalf, aragorn, hobbits looking horrified suddenly frodo coughs takes a huge breath. frodo open his shirt to reveal the mithril vest. the troll spear did not pierce the mithril.\" boom. boom. boom the sound of the drums rings out again. gandalf turns to the others. gandalf leads the fellowship into the huge dwarrowdelf chamber. a huge shadow, surrounded by flame, falls across the hall the ground shakes an unearthly sound rumbles. the balrog, a massive creature rises from a chasm, a great 40 foot man-beast, with a mane of flames. in one hand is a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire in the other, a whip of many thongs. aragorn leads the fellowship to the top of a dizzying stairway gandalf follows, leaning heavily on his staff. aragorn looks at gandalf, concerned. aragorn hesitates gandalf looks at him. the fellowship race down the stairway, aragorn picks up frodo leaping across a gaping chasm. a narrow bridge, spanning a bottomless pit gandalf yells to the others aragorn makes to throw gimli across the chasm. the fellowship run into a hall the floor is split with fissures that spit flame. they race towards the slender bridge of stone without kerb or rail at the far end of the hall. the fellowship recklessly hurry over the dizzying bridge but gandalf the last pauses in the middle of the span he faces the balrog staff in one hand sword in the other. frodo looks back in horror frodo watches as the balrog puts one foot on the bridge and draws up to full height, wings spreading from wall-to-wall. gandalf is a tiny figure, balanced precariously on the narrow bridge. flame gandalf blocks with his sword a ringing clash and the balrog\\'s sword shatters into molten fragments. gandalf cries aloud as he summons up his last reserves of strength. he thumps the bridge with his staff a blinding sheet of white flame springs up the staff shatters the bridge breaks right at balrog\\'s feet. the stone bridge drops away into the gulf from under the balrog. for a moment, the great beast remains poised in the air then it plunges down in slow motion relief floods frodo\\'s face gandalf remains trembling on the lip of the broken bridge. as the balrog falls, he lashes out with his whip of fire the thongs of the whip lash and curl around gandalf\\'s knees, dragging him over the brink. gandalf just manages to hand on by his fingertips gandalf lets go his grip and falls away following the balrog into the bottomless abyss. frodo cries out. boromir scoops him up and carries him away. they rush towards an archway. the fellowship tumble out of the great eastern gate on to a grassy sunlit hillside. sam, merry, and pippin fall slowly to the ground, sobbing aragorn turns to legolas and gimli. frodo slowly turns a look of numb shock on his devastated face. the fellowship marches on. aragorn scours ahead of the company, as they stumble on in the fading light in the distance the shimmer of a large forest can be seen lothlorien. the fellowship run across a forest floor strewn with yellow flowers above is a roof of golden leaves, held up by silver pillars the trunks of huge, grey trees. gimli looks nervously around. frodo hesitates a strange voice whispers in his head. haldir\\'s eyes lock onto frodo. haldir leads the fellowship onto a hill top. they look with wonderment at the vista spread before them. several miles towards the south, a large hill rises out of the woods. upon the hill rise many mighty mallorn trees, taller than any others nestled high in the crown of the mallorns is a beautiful city. it gleams in the low rays of the late afternoon sun green, gold, and silver. to the east of caras galadhon, the woods of lorien run down the pale gleam of anduin, the great river. beyond the river, the land appears flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away, it rises again like a dark and dreary wall. the sun that lies on lothlorien has not power to enlighten the shadows that lie beyond. the fellowship step onto a wide fleet filled with a soft light. the walls are green and silver, the roof gold and in its midst is the trunk of the might mallorn tree, now tapering toward its crown. celeborn steps forward to greet the guests. his hair is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no sign of age upon it. next to him stands galadriel, the lady of the elves. she has hair of deep gold and timeless, unsurpassed beauty. celeborn looks hard at aragorn. frodo looks at galadriel, standing silently beside celeborn. galadriel\\'s eyes settle on sam. side powerful, divine no longer of this world a piercing white light surrounds her. gimli, legolas, merry, pippin, frodo and sam are in a pavilion set among the trees near the fountain. they lie on soft couches as elves leave food and wine for them. mournful singing drifts down from the trees above. moonlight catches the trace of tears on boromir\\'s face. aragorn kneels down beside him. boromir looks at aragorn in despair. aragorn returns boromir\\'s smile betraying his disquiet sadness only when boromir looks away. later. the fellowship are asleep on their beds. gimli is snoring loudly. bare feet tread soundlessly across the lawn. frodo\\'s eyes flicker open as if by instinct. galadriel, her white dress glowing in the moonlight, glances at him. frodo follows her as if drawn by an invisible force. upon a low stone pedestal, carved like a branching tree, sits a shallow silver basin. galadriel leads frodo into the small glade. galadriel pours water into the basin from a silver jug a glow rises from the water. frodo slowly steps up to the pedestal he peers into the glossy surface. the night sky is reflected into the water suddenly a figure takes form the bowed figure of an old man, clad in white robes. he walks down a long road. frodo leans closer to the mirror\\'s surface. gandalf lifts his head and looks directly at frodo. frodo gasps, his face lighting up with hope. gandalf looks at frodo with a fierce intensity. frodo reaches out his hand toward the surface of the mirror. suddenly the image flares, burning out to white. the vision shifts frodo gasps in horror. the shire is in ruins. the image suddenly widens to fill the screen buildings burning bodies strewn about dark shapes of orcs looting and destroying bag end, billowing in flames. the party tree is hacked down. frodo reels back as the mirror seems to grow the nightmarish image sweeps past his head, engulfing him entirely. hobbiton now an industrial wasteland. the fields and trees destroyed replaced with brick factories belching smoke. orcs brutally herd manacled hobbits into the factories. we see sam merry and rosie cotton. soot- stained and sobbing, they disappear into the factory hell- hole. suddenly, the mirror goes dark and out of the black abyss a single eye grows. frodo is frozen. unable to move or cry out. the ring dangles from his neck, inches above the water not shimmering with curls of steam. fire erupts around the eye with a yell, frodo pushes himself away from the pedestal and collapses on the ground. light instantly fades from the mirror. frodo comes to his senses he is shocked. galadriel stands still as a statue, unmoved, untouched by the horror. galadriel looks at frodo intensely frodo looks down in his hand he is clutching the ring. frodo looks up at galadriel. galadriel suddenly seems to rise in stature before frodo\\'s eyes. frodo is suddenly afraid of her. galadriel suddenly laughs a slender elf-woman once more, clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad. frodo realizes what her message is. the ring lies in the palm of frodo\\'s hand his fingers close over it. naked, lurtz\\'s eyes follow saruman, alight with a mean intelligence. lurtz is quickly armored breastplate leg guards, helmet a sword is thrust in lurtz\\'s hand. the uruk- hai are smearing themselves in white paint a creepy ritualistic ceremony the white hand of isengard is smeared on bodies, faces, and armor. saruman address a crowd of 200 fully armed uruk-hai. lurtz is leading 200 uruk-hai out of isengard they run fast, their powerful legs carrying them at speed. the fellowship are in small elven boats. they row away from the lothlorien shore into the silverlode river. elves quietly watch them depart. galadriel gives frodo a small crystal phial. the boats pass into the great river anduin. the three elven boats carry the fellowship steadily southward. green trees slowly give way to a brown and withered land. the uruk forces are running through the trees with deadly purpose. a flock of birds circle high above, black against the pale sky. aragorn watches them with concern. the three elven boats drift slowly through the steep rocky gorge in the pre-dawn light. aragorn, slowly paddling in the stern. frodo slowly looks up, his eyes widening with amazement. two enormous rock statues, towering like 300 foot pinnacles on either side of the river carved images of gondorian kings of old. they loom over the boats with power and majesty. aragorn strangely moved by the beauty of the silent sentinels. he speaks, almost as if to himself. the fellowship stare in stunned silence as the current takes them through the narrow gap between the statues\\' feet. the fellowship as they leap out of the boats and clamber onto the wooded shore. legolas turns to aragorn with urgency. legolas casts a glance around into the parth galen forest. sam sits up with a start aragorn\\'s head snaps round his eyes fly to boromir\\'s shield which lies abandoned by his camp bed. aragorn as he realizes boromir has gone. frodo is walking beneath the trees lost in thought. his feet hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab his eyes follow an overgrown path towards stone stairs leading to the summit of amon hen the seeing seat. a crackling sound. frodo freezes. frodo turns slowly he stares at boromir, tense, cautious. frodo stands silent for a moment the murmur of the wind in the trees and the distant roar of the falls of rauros can be heard boromir has started forward towards frodo, he pulls himself up. frodo steps hurriedly away from boromir. frodo turns to leave. boromir leaps on top of frodo, grasping for the ring. frodo has only moments to act. frodo rips the ring from around his neck and rams it on his finger. frodo races through the misty twilight world, past the foggy shapes of twisted trees. somewhere behind him, boromir\\'s distraught voice carries from another dimension frodo suddenly finds himself on the stone steps he clambers up the stairs, onto a high seat, perched on four stone pillars. frodo cowers on the seat, like a lost child upon the throne of mountain kings. the world of mist swirls around him. frodo peers out from the seat the world seems to shrink. in all directions, views of far off lands telescope towards him through the mist. orcs spilling out of holes in the misty mountains flames rising from mirkwood grim faced easterlings march to war black ships sailing into the south. all the power of the dark lord is in motion. frodo moves his gaze towards the east fire explodes against the smoke, as a huge mass of black battlements fills frodo\\'s vision. a mountain of iron, immeasurably strong, tower of adamant barad-dur, fortress of sauron. suddenly. sauron\\'s eye leaps toward frodo like a finger of light. they will fall. frodo leaps off the seat, and tumbles down the stairs. the eye sweeps amon hen like a searchlight, seeking its ring. with a huge effort, frodo wrenches the ring off his finger. frodo lies gasping on the summit of amon hen below the ancient ruins of the seeing seat. at that moment a black boot steps into shot. frodo looks up as aragorn towers over him. frodo backs away from aragorn aragorn is shocked by the movement. frodo uncurls his fist in is palm lies the ring. it glints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun aragorn\\'s eyes are drawn to it. aragorn freezes. he draws his sword. frodo hesitates. frodo backs away into the trees as 200 uruk-hai swarm onto amon hen behind aragorn. aragorn attacks the leading uruk-hai like a madman he brings two down with his sword leaping into the ruins as others close in on him. frodo scrambles down the hillside, away from the fight. aragorn battles the uruk-hai, amongst the pillars and blocks of amon hen. despite his bravery, he is quickly surrounded suddenly elven arrows smash into the uruk-hai. legolas races out of the woods, firing his bow. gimli leaps into the battle, wielding his might axe. frodo is darting down the steep hillside as heave feet thunder down behind him. sam looks around for frodo. lurtz ordering his uruks. frodo stumbles and falls quickly he crawls behind a tree above him the sound of uruk-hai crashing through the forest rings out. frodo turns to see merry and pippin hidden in a hollow, a few feet away. frodo looks at his friends slowly shakes his head, a great sadness in his eyes. pippin stands and makes a move toward frodo merry grabs at his arm. the echo of boromir\\'s horn reaches aragorn, legolas, and gimli they are battling their way down the slopes towards the lake. aragorn desperately slashes his way towards boromir, felling uruk-hai in his path while legolas and gimli fight a rear guard action. many uruk-hai fall to boromir\\'s sword as he tries to protect merry and pippin. lurtz takes aim. a black arrow suddenly thuds into boromir\\'s chest. amazingly, boromir continues fighting, but another arrow and another, brings him to his knees. merry and pippin are scooped off their feet by uruk-hai. lurtz aims his bow at boromir\\'s heart suddenly aragorn charges at him, smashing the bow with his sword. they lock into a deadly battle. aragorn cuts lurtz down and races towards boromir, who lies slumped against a tree uruk-hai arrows sticking out of his chest. at least 20 dead uruk-hai lie heaped around boromir. his horn lies at his feet cloven in two. boromir holds aragorn\\'s gaze. aragorn places boromir\\'s sword in his hand. boromir\\'s fingers tighten around the hilt. on the lakeshore frodo stands in front of one of the elvish boats, the ring in his palm. a distraught sam running as hard as he can through the forest. frodo looks to the far side of the river the camera moves in on the ring. tears fall down frodo\\'s face. with renewed determination, frodo tucks the ring inside his vest pocket. the small figure of frodo pushing the elvish boat into the water sam bursts through the trees and runs toward the lake frodo is already paddling away. shore tears in his eyes the voice of sam carried on the wind. frodo whispers to himself sam looks at the water then at the boat. splash. frodo turns to see sam launching himself into the water. sam splashes hopelessly toward the boat. sam starts to go under, spluttering and coughing frodo drops his paddle and scrambles backwards in the boat. sam is underwater hands flailing helplessly as he sinks. frodo\\'s hand grasping sam\\'s frodo pulls a bedraggled and half drowned sam into the boat. frodo and sam look at each other, out of breath, tears and water streaming down both their faces. frodo starts to laugh through his tears the two friends hug. the two hobbits row through the water. looking down on swiftly flowing water boromir\\'s body slides under camera. he is lying in one of the boats, his arms across his chest his broken horn at his side. suddenly the boat drops away from camera as it plunges over the massive falls of rauros, disappearing into the vapor below. aragorn looks towards the far shore frodo and sam\\'s small boat can be seen lying on the distant riverbank as frodo and sam make off into the forest beyond. he doesn\\'t react. legolas turns and looks at aragorn. aragorn pulls a hunting knife out of his pack and straps it on. aragorn, legolas, and gimli disappear into the woods, following the uruk-hai trail. frodo and sam scramble onto a high ridge. a distant line of saw toothed mountains below a dark, oppressive sky. black volcanic smoke rises behind the mountains mordor. frodo looks at sam with great affection despite the grim outlook, sam is undeterred. the two hobbits setting off toward mordor.

       "\"camera zooms in through the mountain and focuses on gandalf and the balrog on the bridge of khazad-dum. the balrog strikes down on gandalf with its flaming sword. gandalf parries the blow with glamdring, shattering the balrog's sword. gandalf strikes his staff onto the bridge. as the balrog steps forward, the bridge collapses from under it and the demon plunges backward into the chasm. gandalf, exhausted, leans on his staff and watches the balrog fall then turns to follow the others. at the last minute, the flaming whip lashes up from the depths of the abyss and winds around gandalf's ankle, dragging him over the edge. he clings onto the bridge but is straining to keep his grip. frodo rushes forward but boromir restrains him. gandalf loses his grip and falls into the chasm gandalf loses his grip and falls into the chasm calls after gandalf as he falls into the abyss gandalf falls after the balrog and grabs hold of his sword glamdring on his way down. as they continue to plunge into the depths, gandalf hacks away at the balrog even as it thrashes and bounces off the walls. they continue to plunge at great speed, sometimes with gandalf clinging to the horn of the demon. the battling pair then falls into an enormous cavern and plunges into the water. just then frodo awakens as if from a nightmare. lies back down. frodo and sam climbs over the rocky terrain emyn muil. they look into the distance at the mountain of fire. suddenly frodo feels and sees the eye zooming in on him. he gasps and pants as he backs away. clutches the ring by his chest and sits down, still panting. he then fumbles for his water bottle and takes a sip. he takes out a package of lembas bread from his packhe digs deeper into his pack sam shows another package. he then breaks off a piece and tosses it to frodo, and munches on a piece himself. smiles sam smiles back, and then looks ominously towards mordor. they continue trekking through difficult terrain, often huddling underneath their cloaks. looks around exasperated drops to a whisper nighttime frodo and sam are sleeping. a dark shape appears on top of the cliff. the creature gollum has appeared and is making his way down to the hobbits. gollum creeps closer and closer. gollum reaches out his hand towards the hobbits. suddenly the hobbits spring up, grab hold of gollum's arms and pull him down. amidst the struggle, gollum wriggles loose and leaps onto frodo. as frodo falls back, the chain and ring around his neck is revealed and gollum jumps straight for the ring. sam tries to grab at him but is knocked away. gollum now jumps on top of frodo and tries to reach for the ring even as frodo grabs his hands and tries to push him away. gollum's cheeks puff with exertion as he struggles with frodo, his enormous eyes fixed on the ring. sam grabs hold of gollum again and tears him away from frodo. gollum then turns around and bites sam on the shoulder, wriggles around and clasps his arms around sam's neck and legs around his waist in a death grip. frodo unsheathes sting and holds it to gollum's throat. menacingly slowly, gollum loosens his grip on sam and as the latter disentangles himself, gollum wails. in the next scene, gollum is being dragged with sam's elvish rope around his neck, wailing and writhing in pain. sam tugs fiercely at the rope. gollum cries some more and collapses onto his back. sam turns to frodo in dismay. begging gollum backs away, frightened, and climbs onto a boulder sam jerks strongly at the rope as gollum tries to get away from him. he crashes onto the ground, choking. gollum lies panting and holding his throat. he backs away, frightened, as frodo approaches him. nods warily nods again frodo reaches out and takes the rope noose off gollum's neck. gollum seems surprised and relieved. gollum scrambles off in the direction of morannon and the hobbits follow in his wake. a band of uruk-hai marches across the plain, with two hobbits bound to the backs of two uruk-hai. pippin tries to call to merry, who is unconscious with a gash on his right brow. he receives no response. suddenly, an uruk-hai puts up his hand and signals a stop. sniffs the air quietly to himself the uruk-hai quicken their pace. pippin struggles to reach his elven brooch with his teeth. he then tears it off his cloak and drops it onto the ground. a foot stomps onto the brooch but it remains unbroken and visible on the grass. aragorn is lying with his eyes closed and ear pressed to the ground, listening for the sound of footsteps. he looks up.he runs off. looks back at gimli and then runs after aragorn pauses in his steps and huffsruns after his companions. the three hunters run across rocks and plains, with aragorn in the lead, followed by legolas and gimli. from time to time, legolas looks back to make sure that gimli is keeping up. aragorn suddenly bends down to pick up an elven brooch from the ground. stops and turns to aragorn. runs off again gimli stumbles from behind some rocks and rolls to the ground panting the trackers come over a hill and pause as they gaze across the plains below. legolas runs ahead and looks out to the horizon. the tower of orthanc stands amidst the smoking caverns of isengard. saruman stands in his chamber, communicating with the dark lord through the palantir. view changes to the tower of barad-dur, with its huge orc armies on a bridge. camera pans upwards along the height of the tower of barad-dur until the flaming eye is in view. the trees around isengard are being ripped down, chopped up and used to feed huge furnaces. the caverns of isengard glow with the fires of industry, sounds of hammering fill the air and molten iron is poured into casts to forge weapons. saruman stands in the midst of a gathering of dunlanders. roars with approval they stomp off to destroy the villages of rohan as saruman stands coldly still among the stampede. a rohan village is in pandemonium as people try to escape the on-coming pillage. a woman with her hand on a horse calls out to her children. as morwen puts her onto the horse in front of her brother starts to cry a woman screams the children ride off. looks after them dunlanders and uruk-hai enter the village, burning everything in sights as the rohirrim scream and run in all directions. eothain and freda weep as they look back from a distance. a group of horsemen ride to edoras. eomer is in the lead, carrying a gravely wounded theodred. eowyn runs hastily up the stairs to the golden hall and enters a bedchamber. she runs to the bed. theodred seems to hear her call but is unable to respond. he has a bloody gash on the side of his head. eomer nods to eowyn in the direction of theodred's torso. eowyn draws back the covers and upon seeing theodred's fatal wound, her lips tighten and eyes close. she looks up to catch eomer's eye. eomer and eowyn are speaking to theoden-king who sits motionless on his throne, wizened, and aged beyond his years. appears from the shadows. mumbles feeblygrima leans down close to the king. he drops a helmet onto the ground, which topples over to reveal the white hand of saruman. eomer grabs grima and pins him against a pillar. grima's eyes flicks to right, watching eowyn as she walks by. eowyn stops to stare back for a moment before departing form the hall. eomer jerks grima again and clutches his hand around grima's jaw. grima's eyes look to the left and relax as eomer is suddenly pulled off grima by his thugs. the thugs punch eomer n the stomach uruk-hai and orcs continue to march across the plains with their hobbit captives, with aragorn, legolas, and gimli hot on their pursuits. they continue running over vast distances. the uruk-hai and orcs halt at nightfall, many panting with exertion. as the orcs and uruk-hai take their rest, pippin crawls over towards merry. opens his eyes a group of orcs chops down the trees nearby for firewood. low groans and rumbles start to emerge from the forest. looks towards the forest his eyes rest on the hobbits. shoves at the orcs the other orcs are getting restless. moves towards the hobbits with his blade drawn pippin and merry recoil in fright. ugluk jumps on the orc and cuts off his head, which bounces off the hobbit's shoulders. the uruk-hai and orcs cheer and started tearing into the fresh meat, intestines flying, taking their eyes off the hobbits for a while. their hands still bound, the hobbits try to crawl away. suddenly a foot comes down on merry and pippin is turned onto his back. brandishing a blade in front of pippin's face suddenly, a spear pierces the orc's back. mayhem ensues as riders of rohan burst out from their hiding places and ambush the orcs. gestures for them to make their escape. the hobbits try to escape from the pandemonium to the forest, dodging bodies and stomping feet. suddenly pippin turns onto his face and looks up to a pair of thrashing hooves bearing down on him. the three hunters are still chasing after the uruk-hai. it is dawn. pauses and looks up camera pans over the rock and plains, alternating between the band of uruk-hai and the three hunters giving chase. the trackers hear the sound of horses. aragorn and company hide behind some boulders. a large group of horse-men appears, galloping quickly with their banners flying. aragorn comes out of hiding as they pass, followed by legolas and gimli. at a signal from eomer at the lead, the riders make a quick turn and head towards them, surrounding them in ever-tightening circles. as they stop, they point their long spears menacingly at them. eomer hands his staff to another rider, and gets off his horse. aragorn puts a hand on gimli's shoulder. legolas, in a lightning fast move, points an arrow at eomer. the

and pushes the candle away from the vessel firmly. he walks away towards the balcony. following saruman both of them came onto the balcony of the tower. grima suddenly sees and hears the enormous armies laid out below in neat rows and is astounded and awed. he continues to hold the extinguished candle aloft as he gapes at the vast army below. a horn is sounded, announcing the appearance of saruman. a loud cheer is heard from the army. saruman raises a hand. the army cheers and roars. the camera keeps zooming out from the balcony over the incredible size of saruman's army, past uruk-hai,

horse arrives and nudges aragorn, turning him over and nuzzling him. mumbleshe grabs hold of brego's mane, pulls himself onto the horse and rides slowly to helms deep. arwen is lying on her bed, deep in thought. coming into her room arwen hears him and sits up. walks towards window and looks out arwen sees a vision of her future as elrond speaks. she is dressed as a queen in mourning garb and

pushing his way through the crowd.he sees aragorn.he hugs aragorn. gimli gestures to the hall. as aragorn makes his way in, he runs into legolas who stands waiting. they smile. legolas pauses and looks at aragorn's wounds. to the side, eowyn sees aragorn and smiles joyously and with relief. legolas takes aragorn's hand and gives the evenstar pendant. aragorn looks at the evenstar and claps

through the forest carrying merry and pippin. he comes to a clearing and stops. merry and pippin turns round as they hear movement from the forest around them. they see many more ents like treebeard gathering. merry licks his lips in anticipation. back at helm's deep, the women and children are being led into the caves. old men and young lads are being drafted for war. the women and children say their tearful and reluctant farewells as their fathers, husbands and sons are led away by soldiers. in the armoury, weapons are being distributed. aragorn picks up a battered sword, looks at it and tosses it back. the men around them fell silent. legolas speaks to aragorn. he pauses and then walks away. legolas makes as if to go after him. puts a hand on legolas in the hall puts armour onto theoden the villagers are handed their weapons. an oversized helmet is placed on a wide-eyed boy. another stares at the axe that he is handed with frightened eyes. another child wearing oversized chain mail takes up a huge shield. theoden stands inside the main hall of the keep, his back to the entrance where a bright white light is streaming through. everyone is getting ready for war at the battlements. aragorn is sitting on the steps. he sees a young lad in armour holding a sword looking around nervously. aragorn gives the battered sword a few swings. he hands the sword back to haleth and leans close to him, putting a hand on his shoulder. back at the armoury, aragorn dons his battle gear. his sword is handed to him as he reaches for it. he nods and accepts the sword from legolas. they smile and clap one another on the shoulders. they look at gimli as he walks up to them, struggling with his chain mail. he drops the bundle and the chain mail lands with its length right to the floor. aragorn and legolas bite back smiles. just then, a horn sounds in the background they run out to the battlements. the guards look down in wonderment. to another guard an army of lothlorien elves march up the causeway into the hornburg. they are led by haldir. the rohirrim soldiers look upon them in wonderment and delight as they pass. he looks up to see aragorn, legolas and gimli running down the steps, and smiles he bowshe grabs haldir in a huge embrace. initially stunned, haldir hugs him back lightly. legolas and haldir clasp each other on the shoulder. turning to theoden men and elves are in their positions on the battlements of helm's deep. the sounds of a marching army move closer and closer. the women and children in the caves hear the sounds overhead and are frightened. mothers draw their children close and try to sooth crying babies. the men and elves look out into the darkness, lit by the thousands of torches carried by the huge advancing uruk-hai army and the light bouncing off their armour. with a row of elf archers, gimli is standing beside legolas behind a wall, only the top of his helmet visible. grumbling and straining to look above the wall. legolas smirks. aragorn approaches and stands beside them thunder sounds and lightning flashes, revealing the sea of approaching uruk-hai. the marching and thumping grows louder and louder. lightning flashes and it begins to rain. while the uruk-hai army continues to march at the fortress, an uruk-hai leader steps on a rock outcrop. aragorn is giving commands to the elf warriors. the uruk-hai leader raises his swords and commands his army to stop with a terrifying animalic cry. the uruks stop and growl in anticipation of the upcoming battle and slaughter jumping and straining to see looks at gimli with a grin laughs good-naturedly the uruk leader cries out once, encouraging the uruk-hai to start roaring and thumping their spears furiously.the women and children in the caves huddle together in fear. suddenly, aldor, the old man next to haleth, loses his grip and releases his arrow prematurely, shooting an uruk-hai in the neck. the uruk-hai army stop their roaring and thumping. with a hollow groan, the uruk that was shot collapsed to the ground. the other uruk-hai bare their teeth and roar with anger. with a cry, the uruk-hai leader thrusts his weapon in the air and the uruk-hai army starts charging. the elves notch their arrow and aim. arrows rain down on the uruk-hai below, killing many. to the men more arrows are released. but the uruk-hai army keep advancing, with more replacing those fallen. impatiently the uruk-hai start to load ladders onto the walls, pushing them up with their long spears. the elves draw their blades in preparation for combat. the first ladders are almost reaching the walls with big nasty uruk berserkers on top of them. close combat begins as the uruk-hai climb over the wall. holding up two fingers outragedhe turns to a uruk just climbing over the wall, whacking it in the groin with his axe and killing it as it falls. fires two arrows the ent moot is still in progress. the ents sway a little as they continue to deliberate. merry and pippin are sitting a distance away. suddenly, treebeard nods and turns to the hobbits. gesturing long pause with his eyes closed. angles his head in query impatiently waving a hand merry and pippin roll their eyes in disgruntlement. gimli is standing on the wall between two ladders, hacking away at uruk-hai as they come up camera pans over the uruk-hai below and turns to the causeway. a group of uruk-hai is advancing on the causeway towards the gate in tortoise formation, using their broad shields to block off attacks. directs the elf archers to aim at the uruk-hai column. the elf archers release their arrows. the uruk-hai at the sides are shot and fall down the causeway. but the column keeps advancing. at the bottom of the deeping wall, two spiky bombs are lodge in the sluice gate. the rest opens a path and an uruk-hai carrying a torch starts to run towards the sluice gate. aragorn spots the uruk-hai. legolas shoots the uruk-hai in the shoulder but the latter keeps going legolas shoots the uruk again. it stumbles and then throws it self and the torch at the bombs. an enormous explosion is set off, blowing away a large part of the wall. rock, debris and bodies are thrown up. aragorn is also thrown back by the force of the explosion and on the ground, knocked out. theoden looks on in shock as the uruk-hai streams in past the deeping walls. gimli sees the uruk-hai charging in with aragorn in their path. with a cry, he jumps down from the wall and lands on the uruk-hai army, taking them out as he stands. he is soon overpowered. aragorn gets up and sees gimli falling. he yells to the elves behind him the arrows take out the first group of uruk-hai coming through the hole in the wall. aragorn leads the elves in a charge towards the uruk-hai streaming in. he rushes to gimli's side and picks him up. at the top of the battlements, legolas grabs a shield and sends it sliding across the ground. he then hops onto it and surfs down the steps, releasing three arrows as he goes, and kicking the shield to stab an uruk-hai as he lands at the bottom. at the ent moot the ents look at one another, taken back merry is putting on his jacket. pippin approaches him slowly looking into the distance.turns to pippin and puts a hand on his shoulder pippin looks after merry as he walks away. haldir nods and turns back. gimli is being carried away, kicking and struggling as he goes protesting haldir hacks at a few uruk as he turns towards the gate. suddenly, he is stabbed in his arm. and looks down as his wound in seeming disbelief. an uruk-hai comes up from behind him unnoticed and slices him on the neck. as haldir goes down, he looks around him and sees his kin fallen among dead uruk-hai. sees haldir fallinghe runs up the steps to haldir's side and catches him and he collapses. haldir's head rolls back, his eyes empty and unseeing. aragorn bows his head in grief. then with a cry, he jumps onto a ladder and swings down to the ground, killing as he goes. drawing his sword theoden and his commanders come to the gate, which is under heavy attack. the uruk-hai are knocking down the gate and hacking through the broken wood. theoden stabs at an uruk-hai and receives a lance in his shoulder, blocked by his armour. grimacing in pain, theoden continues to stab at the uruk until led away by gamling. runs up and stabs away at the uruk-hai through the broken gate aragorn and gimli slip out a side exit and stand on a ledge just to the side of the main gate. aragorn peeks over, seeing the large band of uruk-hai storming the gate. gimli takes a peek and then steps back. mumbles aragorn nods slowly and then turns to grab the dwarf. gimli stays aragorn's hand he tosses gimli to the head of the causeway and then leaps over. making quick work of killing the uruk-hai on the other side of the gate men are bracing the gate with wood and nails. aragorn and gimli continue to fight off the uruk-hai just outside. meanwhile the uruk-hai load and fires enormous hooks over the battlements. hundred of uruk-hai climb onto super-ladders as they are pulled up towards the walls, the super-ladders locking onto the edge of the battlements with their steel grips. legolas takes aim as another super-ladder is being pulled up and shoots away one of the ropes. the ladder falls back onto the uruk-hai army. through a crack in the gate legolas calls to them from the top of the battlements he throws them a rope aragorn grabs gimli in one hand and the rope with the other as they are pulled up the wall. just then the uruk-hai load and fires enormous hooks over the battlements. hundred of uruk-hai climb onto super-ladders as they are pulled up towards the walls, the super-ladders locking onto the edge of the battlements with their steel grips. legolas takes aim as another super-ladder is being pulled up and shoots away one of the ropes. the ladder falls back onto the uruk-hai army. they all run towards the keep, legolas firing two arrows into the uruk-hai army as he goes. treebeard is walking through the forest, carrying merry and pippin. the hobbits look dejected. pippin suddenly looks up with a gleam in his eyes. treebeard comes to a stop. faramir and company draws close to osgiliath. with tears in his eyes faramir hesitates for a moment. he presses them on frodo and sam are pushed on towards osgiliath treebeard, merry and pippin come to the southern edge of the forest. he sees the desolated landscape of tree stumps that used to be forested grounds with tears in his eyeshis gaze turns to the treeless isengard and its smoking caverns he lets out a ferocious roar that echoes through the forest merry and pippin turn around as they hear rumbles from the forest. they see many ents emerging and marching towards them osgiliath is still under siege as faramir and company arrives, dodging arrows and falling rocks. frodo suddenly seems stricken frodo sees that sam is speaking to him but he hears nothing. his senses are overcome. sam breaks away as they are being led away. a boulder crashes into a tower overhead and shatters it. suddenly, frodo's eyes roll up and he stares at faramir strangely. in a faraway voice looking uphe grabs the hobbits and thrusts them into a corner.to his men banners of the white hand are flying from the battlements of helm's deep. the hornburg is overrun with uruk-hai. theoden and company are in the hall of the keep. carrying a table with legolas to shore up the door of the hall in the glittering caves, the women and children cry in fear as they hear the battering ram banging on the door. there is no answer. pause a light of determination shines in his eyes aragorn looks up at a window to see faint light streaming through. he recalls gandalf's words. gimli runs up the steps to the horn of helm hammerhand he mounts his horse and puts on his helmet. the sound of the horn rumbles through helm's deep as gimli blows with gusto. theoden leads the charge out of the keep into the hornburg, slashing away at the uruk-hai as they go. without pause, they storm out of the gate and down the causeway, right into the column of waiting uruk-hai. in the midst of battle, aragorn looks east and sees a white rider against the rising sun coming up from behindhe raises a hand riders move up behind eomer. looking to the east the rohirrim and the white rider charge down the slope. half the uruk-hai army turns to face the challenge, bearing their spears down towards the riders. as the riders draw closer, the sun rises behind them, momentarily blinding the uruk-hai who raise the hands and spears to shield their eyes. the riders crash right into the uruk-hai and engage them in battle. the ents are stomping over isengard, swinging their huge limbs, throwing and stamping on orcs and rolling huge boulders over the ground. an ent is pulled down with chains by some orcs, who immediately jump on and hacks away at his wooden limbs. saruman rushes out onto the balcony of orthanc and stares at the pandemonium in incredulity. merry and pippin also throws stones at orcs, their aims true. two ents rock a wooden structure and push it over into the caverns below, smashing against the rock. some orcs fire flamed-tipped arrows at an ent, setting him on fire. saruman continues to look about from his balcony, helpless. some ents are now breaking away at a dam. the dam is broken and saruman looks up to see the river rushing down the slope towards isengard, washing away orcs and wooden structures in its path. the hobbits tighten their hold on top of treebeard treebeard braces himself against the flood. as the water rushes over isengard, an ent rushes in and thrusts his burning body into the water. the water rushes into the caverns, washing away the bridges, mechanisms and structures within. frodo walks slowly away from the safe corner. gondorian rangers are still running about, defending their stations. slow motion frodo walks up some stairs and stands on a bridge. a nazgul on a fell beast emerges in front of him. frodo stares at the nazgul, fixated. feeling the call of the ring, he holds it up. faramir watches the unfolding tableau from below. as frodo moves to put the ring on his finger and the nazgul flies closer and closer, sam runs up and knocks frodo over. faramir releases an arrow and shoots the fell beast. frodo and sam roll down the stairs. as they come to a stop at the bottom, frodo holds sam in a death grip, yells and points sting at his throat, his eyes livid with madness and anger that someone would try to take the ring away. with tears running down his face the madness fades and recognition returns to frodo's eyes. he realises what he nearly did and is overcome. stumbling backwards, he collapses against a wall and sting falls to the ground with a clang. sam gets up slowly. slowly and with despair getting up slowlyhe stands and leans against a wall, looking out into the distance.images of the riders winning the battle against the uruk-hai at helm's deep he raises his sword with a victorious cry the women and children welcome the men as they return. eowyn runs up to aragorn and embraces him, crying tears of relief.isengard is flooded. merry and pippin looks on from their perch on treebeard. on the balcony, saruman stumbles back into his chamber standing in a corner, even gollum seems moved. faramir walks over and comes to kneel in front of frodo sam shakes the ranger's hand from his shoulder. frodo looks up at faramir with gladness. over in the realm of rohan, gandalf, theoden and company ride to the top of a slope, looking towards the mountain of fire in the distance. frodo and sam are walking through the woods, away from osgiliath. frodo turns to look at sam. smilinghe turns to walk on dreamilyhe gives his backpack a heave and follows frodo gollum is crouching a short distance away twists the branch of a tree scuttles and hides behind a tree bites on his finger and nods eagerly backs away against a tree he looks in the direction of the hobbits softly and sinisterly he pops out from hiding in front of the hobbits. he turns to walk on, with frodo and sam following behind. camera pans up over the forest and ephel d'ath to reveal the desolation of mordor. to the left of the frame is the glowing eye of sauron atop barad-dur, and to the right of the frame is the fiery mount doom. three fell beasts circle the dark skies. lightning flashes as the scene fades to black. \""

ominous sounds of wind rising huge wings beating. spinning angle faramir looks up at the sky ithilien rangers are suddenly nervous, frightened a huge shadow passes overhead. a sudden terrifying shriek rends the air. soldiers retreating through the ruins of the city as, high in the sky above, the nazgul swoop. madril as he is cut down by an orc. madril his breathing quick and shallow footsteps approach. the hideously deformed features of gothmog standing over the prone figure of the injured ranger. grabbing a spear from a nearby underling, gothmog drives the shaft into madril\\'s chest. gothmog surveys the carnage with satisfaction. faramir and a few survivors flee west osgiliath, desperately riding toward minas tirith in the sky above dark shapes pursue them. suddenly, from on high, the nazgul strike. tilt down following the nazgul as it swoops out of low- lying, murky clouds tossing men in the air like limp rag-dolls. at that moment across the plain, a figure clothed in white

remains at the rear, trying desperately to fend off the deadly assault. again the fell-beasts dive low. gandalf thunders into view, raising his staff. a shaft of white light suddenly stabs upwards. the nazgul swerves away from the light, as it pierces the low cloud. for a brief moment, sunlight streams through the hole onto pelennor fields the nazgul circle away from the sun rays, swiftly spiralling higher and higher. the nazgul defeated, gandalf and the rangers ride towards the safety of minas tirith. iorlas runs towards the gates, yelling. as gandalf pulls shadowfax up. faramir steers his horse through the crowd towards gandalf. faramir suddenly stares at pippin. gandalf reads the surprise in his eyes. faramir shakes his head. faramir nods. gandalf, deeply troubled. frodo and sam following gollum up the dizzying stairway, carved into the sheer cliff. the steps are narrow, unevenly spaced, and many are broken. they are so steep that frodo and sam climb as if on a ladder their desperate fingers clinging to the steps above - trying not to look at the long black fall below them. frodo\\'s foot slips and for a brief moment he is hanging precariously from the rock-face. gollum peering down from above he has reached a small ledge. gollum rears back in shock tenses like a cat, eyes widening. frodo, head bowed, trying to pull himself up. he doesn\\'t notice gollum\\'s hand reaching for the ring . gollum\\'s fingers closing in on the ring. sam, still teetering on the precipitous stairs draws his sword. startled, frodo looks down at sam, losing his footing in the process. sam\\'s horrified face as. gollum\\'s out-stretched hand suddenly grasps frodo\\'s arm pulling him safely onto the ledge. gollum glares down at sam. gollum blinks, masking the malice of his eyes with their heavy pale lids. gollum creeps close to frodo and whispers in his ear frodo looking at sam his hand strays to his neck, closing tight around the ring. high above osgiliath, the sinister profile of the witch king seated on a fell beast as gothmog stands, awaiting his orders. slowly the witch king\\' s head turns. reactions of gondorian soldiers upon the minas tirith

turns to leave, stops, turns back. denethor continues with his meal. faramir exits. high above minas morgul, on the small ledge next to the stairs, lie the figures of frodo, sam and gollum. sam watches a sleeping gollum suspiciously as he desperately tries to stay awake. slowly, inevitably, sam, falls asleep. gollum\\'s eyes snap open he sits up and quietly crawls towards sam\\'s knapsack. sam breathes deeply now, heavily asleep. gollum grimaces in distaste as he pulls out the lembas bread . quietly he sprinkles crumbs over the sleeping sam. gollum as he throws the remaining lembas bread over the cliff. sam\\'s eyes flick open gollum spins around, caught off guard. too exhausted to argue, sam turns away. sam gently shakes frodo\\'s shoulder. - sam rummages through his knapsack, looking for a bite to eat. frodo sits up slowly. sam stops rummaging shock on his face. sam slowly turns to gollum. gollum slaps his hand against sam\\'s jacket sending lembas crumbs raining down. sam

gate people are rushing forward, throwing flowers over the knights. gandalf hurries alongside faramir\\'s horse. gandalf reads the pain in faramir\\'s eyes he calls after him, trying one more time to stop the young man. faramir leads the 200 mounted knights through the gates of minas tirith and across the pelennor fields towards the ruins of osgiliath. the people of minas tirith watch from the battlements. faramir\\'s knights fan out to form one straight line of 200 horsemen. gothmog and his men watch as the knights approach. fast push in to pippin looking on as denethor eats. pippin\\'s simple, clear voice echoes through the vast hall. tracking with the 200 mounted knights. gothmog rises amidst the ruins of osgiliath. faramir\\'s knights - 75 yards away - thundering towards camera. faramir yelling defiantly. faramir\\'s 200 knights ride straight into a black wall of flying arrows. as one, the horses and horsemen collapse into a cartwheeling, tumbling heap within seconds all are motionless. fast cuts of screaming orcs. throughout the above sequence denethor has continued to eat. pippin finishes his bittersweet song he looks up at denethor who continues as if he has not sent his son to his death. pippin turns away, his sorrow etched on his young face. gandalf sits quietly in a courtyard, alone, defeated. great siege towers and catapults are roll along the reparied bridge which spans both sides of osgiliath they head straight towards minas tirith. aragorn, theoden, eomer, merry, legolas and gimli gallop into a vast camp beneath the cover of trees teeming with men, horses and tents. theoden acknowledges grimbold, a marshall of rohan, as he passes by a group of soldiers. theoden smiles grimly as he rides on. aragorn joins theoden on a bluff overlooking the encampment below. thousands of men and horses. smoke from many small camp-fires has filled the valley with a twilight haze. aragorn turns to theoden. theoden realising what aragorn is saying - no matter the numbers he must commit to war by the morning. theoden nods. the horses whinny loudly in the distance theoden looks up at the mountain which looms behind them. horses rearing in terror as rohan soldiers try to quieten them. legolas and gimli move through the camp. legolas looking at a group of rohan soldiers they sit quiet and hunched no-one speaking. legolas looking toward eomer who is unsaddling his horse. gimli\\'s eyes travel to a row of ancient standing stones that mark the entrance to a road leading away from the encampment and into the mountain. aragorn stands before the road as though transfixed before him a horse whinnies and pulls at his ropes nervously. a ghostly figure seems to emerge from the gloom aragorn starts in fright as. aragorn stares down at the little dwarf. aragorn casts another look back at the ancient standing stones before following gimli. all is quiet in the encampment. eowyn kneels before merry, adjusting his helmet strap. merry exhales - excited and terrified in equal measure. in his excitement, he draws his sword. eowyn steps back, laughing. as eowyn and merry leave the tent, eomer and gamling are sitting nearby, finishing a meal

a horse and rider move along the ridge. the hooded figure slowly rides up the narrow zig- zag track leading up to the plateau. in aragorn\\'s dream arwen suddenly wakes. as arwen lies dying, the evenstar falls from her fingers at that moment, aragorn wakes, his sword quickly in his hand a guard stands in the doorway. aragorn hurries towards theoden\\'s tent. - theoden looks up as aragorn enters. theoden bows slightly to the hooded figure and leaves, shooting aragorn a strange look as he goes. the figure stands and pulls back the hood to reveal elrond. elrond\\'s face is etched with pain. elrond\\'s eyes fall to the evenstar which hangs around aragorn\\'s neck. aragorn looks at elrond in shock. a fleet of black sails moving along a silver ribbon of water . elrond hesitates a beat. a sudden wind rushes through the tent, lifting hangings, scattering maps, knocking over goblets. as aragorn looks at elrond, an image flashes in his mind\\'s eye the ghostly figure on the dimholt road. aragorn looks at elrond in shock. aragorn\\' s eyes fall to a plain black scabbard, which elrond draws from beneath his robes. elrond\\' s long white fingers draw the hilt of a sword from the scabbard to reveal a elven sword glints in the firelight. aragorn takes the sword staring at it in wonder. aragorn draws the long blade from its sheath. elrond stares hard at aragorn. a heavy silence hangs in the room. aragorn re-sheathes the sword. as aragorn readies brego for leaving eowyn approaches her temper barely held in check. aragorn looks over his shoulder at her. aragorn looks at her sadly, not wanting to hurt her. eowyn steps back at though struck she watches stricken as aragorn leaves. aragorn leads his horse through the tents towards the dimholt road. a light flares ahead.of him. a short figure steps out of the shadows pipe in hand. aragorn looks at gimli - grateful for his courage but determined to go alone. aragorn shakes his head, smiling his acceptance. aragorn, legolas and gimli as they slowly ride towards the back of the plateau past the ancient standing stones that lead to the narrow pass. theoden and gamling watch the retreating figures of aragorn, legolas and gimli rohan soldiers emerge from their tents, crestfallen to see aragorn leave. aragorn, legolas and gimli disappear into the shadows of the mountains. the rohan soldiers murmur among themselves, \"what\\'s happening?\", \"where\\'s he going?\" theoden as he moves forward. theoden looks at eowyn who stands as if turned to stone she is looking up at a lightening sky the quiet before the men depart for war. eowyn turns to the king her face a blank she speaks without emotion. theoden moves towards her, taking up her hand. eowyn slowly lifts her head. theoden lifts eowyn faces to look into her eyes. aragorn, legolas and gimli make their way up a. gloomy canyon, shadowed by black fir trees. the shadowed ridges of the dwimorberg mountain rise before them. silence surrounds them, there are no birds, no wind. only the ominously muffled thud of their horses hooves on the dank fir- needles. \\' before them, at the root of the mountain, a sheer wall of rock towers. within the walls, a creepy dark door gapes like a mouth of night. signs and figures are carved above its wide arch. at that moment a chill wind seems to rush out of the doorway aragorn stares into the blackness, his hair blowing wildly. the horses rear and\\'buck\\'in terror, turning and galloping away. aragorn walking into the blackness. legolas quickly follows swallowed by the darkness. gimli left alone he hesitates, struggling with hi fear. gimli plunges into the tunnel behind the others. much activity horns sound the entire camp is on the move fires are doused, tents pulled down, horses

and excited. king theoden breaks away from a column and rides up to merry. king theoden wheels his horse away. merry is bitterly disappointed. he stands, head down - a tiny dejected figure - as the mighty rohirrim on their large horses ride by a jangling sea of helmets, shields and banners. suddenly merry is plucked off the ground. a soldier has snatched him by the collar and plonked him down on their saddle. merry twists around, looking up at the soldier beneath a helmet and mail hood is. eowyn, disguised as a man. merry\\'s face visible under the cape looking excited. the valley floor as

marching in ragged ranks. flowing torrents of orcs stream past cave trolls, beating the drums of war minas tirith lies ahead - only two miles away. aragorn leads legolas and gimli into a wide cavern he waves his torch through the darkness illuminating a huge, cavern. a ghastly cracking noise, like stone being sundered, cuts through the silence. aragorn, legolas and gimli look on in horror, as a mummified spectre looms before them eyeless sockets rotten teeth a pale sickly glow the king of the dead. fog swirls around as the ghost snarls at aragorn. aragorn moves forward unflinching. the king

amongst the soldiers. denethor looks down at faramir\\'s unconscious body. pippin has run to faramir and bends towards him. denethor slowly turning away walking as if in a trance. denethor has reached the edge of the courtyard he stares in shocked disbelief at the vista spread out below a full view of the orc army from the top of minas\\'tirith. 75,000 orcs are spread out across the pelennor fields like a sea of black ants. trolls load the catapults with rocks. battering rams and siege towers are hauled on chains. thousands of flickering torches give the army the look of a moving city in the

boulder smashes into a balcony full of civilians. confusion and panic spreads amongst the soldiers. pippin, shocked. suddenly thwack. gandalf\\'s staff smashes into the back of denethor\\'s head. gandalf grimly swings his staff again, clubbing denethor to the ground. gandalf gallops down the winding labyrinthine streets on shadowfax against the flow of fleeing soldiers. shadowfax bounds up stairs onto the level one battlements gandalf looks at the approaching orc army, now less than 50 yards from the walls of the city. mighty wooden catapults positioned within the walls of minas tirith are fired. thwat. thwat. thwat. catapults send their great rocks high into the air, over the battlements. dizzying aerial shots of huge boulders flying up close to camera then falling away towards the orcs. crunch boulders flatten orcs. thwat 100 more rocks thwat another 1 0 0 the orc front ranks are in disarray. as the great bloulders land among them the orc start to panic. gandalf walks the battlements as the huge boulders rain onto the orc army below. gothmog glances up at a whistling sound - a huge boulder hurtles towards him. he side-steps calmly out of the way spitting on the boulder in contempt. suddenly. 9 nazgul dive out of the dim sky, clad in battle armour. soldiers throw themselves down as the nazgul zoom overhead, emitting their piercing shrieks. gondorian soldiers run for shelter in panic, covering their ears. pippin cowering. mighty wooden catapults positioned within the walls of minas tirith are fired. the nazgul circle low over the city, like vultures seeking doomed

falling masonry. too late. the towers reach the walls, their doors crashing down, releasing orcs directly onto the lower levels. as the orc swarm from the tower, gandalf realises pippin has come down from the citadel. pippin looks on stunned, as a huge orc leaps towards him gandalf intercepts the beast, striking him with his staff. gandalf welds his staff, cutting through the attacking orc with ease behind him, an orc prepares to cut down gandalf pippin instinctively slashes his sword at him. gandalf turns on pippin, smiling despite himself. out of black swirling battle. smoke crawls an iron monster. a massive wheeled battering ram . 60 feet high and 150 feet long pushed by 20 huge mountain trolls a massive iron head, cast in the likeness of a snarling wolf. this is grond the battering ram from hell. the ore are chanting as the beast is wheeled closer and closer to the gates. gandalf blanching at the sight of this crawling iron monster\"\\'. gollum leads frodo up a long ravine between columns of torn and weathered rock. ahead is a great grey wall, a last huge mass of mountain- stone and in the shadows at the base of the towering rock lies a tunnel. frodo reacts to the foul stench coming out of the black hole. smeagol sensing his plan unravelling. everything depends on frodo going inside the tunnel frodo stares into the darkness. gollum, his sparse oily hair hanging like rank weed over his hooded eyes. drawing a deep breath, frodo follows gollum into the tunnel. frodo nearly gags they continue on, deep into the dark tunnel frodo is feeling his way in the dark, following the sound ,of gollum\\'s scampering , ,. frodo follows the sound of gollum\\'s voice. he is very tired. frodo cannot see gollum in the murky tunnel. gollum is nowhere to be seen only his voice echoes back down the labyrinth of tunnels. frodo freezes. no answer, no echo, not even a tremor in the air. frodo realises with horror that gollum has deserted him. frodo breathing hard passing all manner of creatures, trussed up in evil web-like material. a bubbling hiss can be heard there is a creaking as some great jointed thing moves with slow purpose in the dark. frodo begins to run in blind panic. sam stumbles blindly down the ancient stairs, reckless and uncaring, his face pale and devastated. sam\\'s foot slips. suddenly, as if the ground has given way beneath him, sam is slipping and sliding dangerously out of control. sam thudding into a large rock, which saves him. from tumbling headlong over the precipice. something catches sam\\'s eye he stares, barely breathing. a package of lembas bread. sam looking back up the long steep stair. frodo is running blindly he falls, trapped in the sticky substance which clings to him. as he lays on the ground, unable to move, a voice comes to him as if froma distant-,, memory. frodo fumbles in his jacket, fear growing in him he pulls out the glass phial - his gift from galadriel - he holds it aloft. the phial flickers kindles into a silver flame - a bright radiant starlight. shelob the spider hisses at the light. two great clusters of many-windowed eyes protrude from her bulbous head. her legs are bent, with a 12 foot span and hairs that stick out like steel spines. her huge, swollen body, a vast bloated bag, sways and sags between her legs. her age-old black hide is knobbly and pitted, blotchy with livid marks but her belly underneath is pale and luminous. shelob beats the air with her forelegs. calling up all his remaining strength and resolution, frodo forces his legs to move he backs away - keeping his eyes on shelob. shelob crawls slowly towards him then, with sudden . hideous speed, she attacks. she lashes out with her front legs frodo is flung back the glass phial clatters to the tunnel floor, casting an eerie low light. shelob squats above frodo, her eye clusters fidgeting with hideous delight, gloating over a prey trapped beyond all hope of escape. suddenly. frodo draws sting. he slashes wildly at the giant spider hewing off the tip of a leg. shelob spasms a wild blur of thrashing legs. frodo leaps to his feet and runs - not even pausing to pick up the phial of light. with frodo as he careers blindly down narrow tunnels, gasping in the choking air looking back over his shoulder for any sign of shelob. frodo sees the tunnel exit ahead. just as he runs straight into a great cobweb. gollum on the other side of the web. frodo as he slashes wildly with sting. the shining blade of sting as it hacks through the fibrous strands. they whip and snap back into frodo\\'s face as he cuts himself free. back up the tunnel - lit by the light of galadriel - shelob\\'s heaving shadow approaches. gollum watches in mounting disbelief as sting slashes through the web disbelief turns to fear as shelob gets closer and closer, gollum quickly turns and bolts. frodo hacks at the web and with a last desperate lunge, frees himself sting is caught in the web frodo leaves the sword and throws himself through a narrow crevice. frodo stumbles out of shelob\\'s lair tumbling onto cold rock. frodo covered in cobwebs, wild-eyed and drenched in sweat - h e looks up as gollum lunges at him. gollum and frodo fight rolling on the ground towards the edge of a precipice. frodo\\'s fingers squeeze tighter around gollum\\'s throat. frodo has a sudden moment of self realisation and releases gollum, horrified at his violence. gollum cowering back coughing and spluttering. frodo looking at smeagol, in shock, he gets to his feet. smeagol stares at frodo in disbelief in a fury he lunges at frodo who falls backwards, dangerously close to the edge of the precipice - gollum tumbles over frodo\\'s body and falls to the bottom of the ravine. frodo, overcome with exhaustion, stumbles down the steep stairs of cirith ungol he is full of remorse at his treatment of sam. frodo falls t o his knees -- frodo lands on soft green grass. sun drenched of trees of fields of lothlorien hazy galadriel walking towards him, bare-foot on the gr ss a galadriel leans down towards frodo, offering her hand for a beat, frodo stares at her torn, not wanting to go on, wanting to lie down but he knows what he must do. frodo as he is lifted to his feet. frodo - once again in the dark, rank, tunnels of the pass of cirith ungol he goes on. flaming missiles rain down on the city. a deep boom. grond thuds against the minas tirith gate sending a - vibration running through the city. gandalf, on shadowfax, leads several hundred gondorian foot soldiers down through the streets. pippin watches as faramir\\'s unconscious body is carried on the stretcher by denethor\\'s servants lead by denethor it has the atmosphere of a funeral. an iron door creaks open faramir\\'s procession enters a wide vaulted chamber. the lantern lig ht throws great shadows upon the shrouded walls of a wide vaulted chamber. row upon row of marble tombs are visible in the dim light. upon each tomb lies a sleeping form, carved in stone, hands folded. denethor speaks in a hushed voice. the servants place faramir\\'s unconscious body on a stone table in the centre of the chamber. they stand, heads bowed as mourners beside a bed of death. denethor turns to his servants. booomm the gate splinters under grond\\'s mighty weight behind the gates the gondorian foot soldiers are fearful. gandalf rallies the line of bowmen as they wait in front of the great doors their courage wavering with each crashing b ow l . suddenly the fearsome head protrudes into the minas tirith. within moments the gate is smashed and giant cave trolls enter into the first circle of minas tirith, under the archway that no enemy had ever passed. rows of archers fire off a volley of arrows but the trolls continue to smash the foot soldiers with their giant clubs orcs swarm through the opening and the pitched, hand-to- hand battle spills into flames and blackened, smouldering buildings through the streets of minas tirith. with a roar, gandalf leads a counter attack on shadowfax, followed by several hundred gondorian foot \" \" soldiers. thousands of orcs swarm in through the city gates the first level is breached. frodo staggers through the pass of cirith ungol the weight of the ring, dragging at his neck. he moves forward, fueled by a grim resolve. frodo starts climbing a stone staircase that climbs through a narrow pass tall peaks rise on either side, like pillars holding up a sagging sky. frodo stays close to the rock wall, masked by shadows. behind frodo, shelob appears. with hideous stealth, she follows frodo. frodo slowly climbing the stone stairs his gaze and concentration on the orc tower. behind him, shelob lurches into a horrible scuttle down the sheer rock face. frodo suddenly senses the lurking malice he spins around before he can react, shelob viciously stabs frodo in the neck with her monstrous abdominal stinger. frodo instantly goes limp shelob\\'s legs catch him as he around him. with falls she quickly starts weaving cobwebs great dexterity, she tumbles the little hobb it over and over in her legs, binding him in web from head to toe. suddenly the razor sharp edge of a sword comes into shot. samwise gamgee stands before the giant spider - sting clutched in one hand, the shining phial in the other. shelob hisses at sam dropping frodo he rolls down the stairs in his web cocoon. sam moves forward, a fell light in his normally friendly eyes sam swings the small sword slashing upward. sam ducks inside the arch of her legs and stabs sting into one of her eye clusters. shelob screams, her mandibles thrashing wildly, green ooze trickling from her wounded eye. with hind legs, shelob picks sam off the ground and tosses him backwards. sam lands heavily and shelob pounces. shelob heaves the great bag of her belly high above sam\\'s head. as she splays her legs to drive her huge bulk down on him, sam lifts the elven blade above his head, holding it with two hands. sting slides into shelob\\'s soft underbelly. a shudder runs through her. heaving up. again, she wrenches herself away from the pain her limbs writhing beneath her. jerking and quivering, shelob crawls to her hole, leaving a trail of green-yellow slime. she squeezes down the hole and disappears the sound of her bubbling misery fades. sam races to frodo. sam rips cobwebs away from frodo\\'s head his face is deathly pale. frodo\\'s pale, lifeless face. frodo\\'s head lolls lifelessly in sam\\'s arms. frodo staring, unmoving. sam lays his face on frodo\\'s chest weeping softly. sting\\'s blade glows blue. tramping feet approach clinking metal harsh shouts. sam looks up looks back down frodo. sam looks up at the orc tower and then at sting which is glowing blue. orcs approach - sam must make a decision. a small party of orcs and uruk-hai heading down the stairs from the watch tower shagrat leads the uruk-hai, and gorbag leads the orcs. gorbag spies frodo\\'s body. gorbag peer curiously at frodo as he leans down and pokes at frodo\\'s lifeless body. the orcs grunt as they lift frodo and carry him back towards the watch tower. orc laughter frodo is carried up the steep stairs  from the shadows pippin watches, aghast, as faramir is lain on a funeral pyre. denethor kisses faramir\\'s sweating, fevered brow. bundles of dried firewood are being stacked around faramir\\'s body. denethor grabs pippin by the collar. he roughly carries him towards the door. denethor throws pippin outside. denethor slams the door shut. pippin races down the steep streets passing soldiers running back from the burning city. great balls of fire are hurtling through the air the city is in chaos. amidst the fleeing soldiers. gothmog turns to his second lieutenant. as orc run through the streets, men, women, and children flee the pitched battle continues. suddenly. in the midst of the battle, gandalf turns shrill and clear come the sounds of distant horns. off the side of mount milldolluin, they dimly echo - war horns of the west rohan has come. gothmog turns at the sound of the distant horns. minas tirith lies less than a mile away, down a gentle slope. over 50,000 orcs are swarming around the base of the city thick black smoke belches from within it. merry blanches with fear eowyn puts a comforting hand on his shoulder. the orcs prepare for battle. theoden gallops in front of his army, issuing urgent orders to his captains theoden rides to the front of his army. he rises in his stirrups, tall and proud, yelling in a clear, loud voice a ray of sunlight escapes through the black clouds, bathing the rohirrim in golden light. weapons and armour gleams as 6000 horsemen hold their spears aloft. below, on pelennor field, the orc kneel and raise their lances in readiness. eowyn, her arm around merry before her. merry looks on in shock. as theoden rides past the ranks of soldiers he runs his lance along their spears the noise echoes through the ranks as the weapons of other riders clatter in response. t h eo de n f ac es hi s e ne my . merry is swept up in the emotion . he whips out his little sword. all the horns of the rohirrim burst blast

astride faramir, pouring oil over his own head it runs through his hair and down his face, quickly soaking his robes. faramir, his eyes flicker open. as he tries to focus through his delirium, oil splashes onto his chest and face. bundles of oil-soaked wood are stacked all around them. servants are holding flaming torches, awaiting their orders denethor nods to them the servants approach the pyre, torches held firmly. at that moment gandalf and pippin burst into the hallows, astride shadowfax. the fearful servants back away from the pyre. whoosh. the pyre ignites. gandalf gallops toward the pyre, knocking denethor to his feet pippin leaps from shadowfax onto the burning pyre. with a desperate strength, pippin pushes faramir off the burning pyre they tumble down the bundles of wood, onto the floor. pippin douses flames on faramir\\'s clothing. denethor screams with rage. denethor leaps across the pyre, ripping and tugging at pippin. fire quickly spreads up denethor\\'s oil-soaked back as he hauls pippin off faramir. shadowfax rears up and strikes at denethor who falls back onto the pyre . denethor he looks into his son\\'s eyes for a brief moment sanity returns. flames begin to engulf denethor. gandalf pulls pippin to safety they look in horror as. suddenly. denethor lurches off the pyre. now a screaming, unguided ball of flame, he runs across the chamber, disappearing out of the door. denethor runs across the white court atop minas tirith and plummets straight over the 700 foot sheer drop into the flaming city below. denethor\\'s death plunge to the rohirrim gaining the upper hand - vast numbers of orcs are slain, or are fleeing. theoden stands proud in his saddle, yelling to his rohirrim. theoden his look of joy turns to horror. \" across the vast sea of battle come. 20 mumakil. massive elephant-like creatures, each carrying a war-tower, packed with haradrim archers. rohirrim riders panicking. theoden on his horse, circling amongst them. rohirrim horses moving back into line. rohirrim riders charge towards the line of mumakil. the mumakil bellow as they are goaded into war, driven mercilessly by their brutal haradrim masters. they lumber into the sea of men, crushing riders and horses beneath their massive feet. th eir spiked tusks swing wildly, sweeping and impaling riders. haradrim archers are sending a rain of arrows into the panicking rohirrim. eowyn and merry are thrown from their horse. the sixth level of the city smoke rising around it, fires burning beneath it. a rabble of orcs are clustered outside the sixth gate as trolls pound on its wooden doors with huge hammers. wood splinters the doors are near breaking point. gandalf and pippin sit on stone steps both covered in sweat and grime, bone-weary from fighting, spirits and hearts bruised. pippin looks towards the wooden gates at which a number of soldiers continue to build a barricade. gandalf looks at the small hobbit a beat. gandalf looks down to see pippin looking up at him with fear in his eyes. gandalf breaks off, lost in reverie. pippin stares up at the old wizard\\'s face, softened, quiet and full of peace. boom. gandalf and pippin\\'s faces turn as the wooden doors shudder under another blow. the battlefield is in chaos as mumakil decimate the valiant rohirrim. theoden tries to rally his men amid the sea of crying men and neighing horses. suddenly the witch-king swoops down on his nazgul scooping up theoden and his horse they cartwheel into the air and land in a heap the horse is .dead theoden lies dying beneath it. the witch-king swooping down on his fell-beast. the fell-beast lands on theoden\\'s dead horse. the fell-beast opens it\\'s wicked jaws. a rohan soldier stands before the beast it is eowyn. the witch-king laughs. the fell-beast lifts eowyn from her feet. suddenly. with a mighty sword blow, the fell-beast\\'s head is severed. the huge creature crumples to the ground, vast wings out-stretched, sending the witch-king sprawling. eowyn stands before him,the fell-beast\\'s blood dripping from her sword. with a shrill shriek of hatred, he knocks eowyn backwards with his mace. stunned eowyn tries to stand and is hit once again with another crippling blow. the witch-king laughs once again as he smashes his mace downward eowyn tries to block the blow but her shield shatters into many pieces. the witch-king towers over eowyn raising his mace for the killing blow. an orc commander hurrying on to the anduin river docks, close to the city. large black shadows slide across the docks, as sailing ships approach o.s. a sinister black sailed ship glides into the \"docks 9 other corsair ships follow behind. the orc commander. aragorn leaping from the leading ship and charging across the docks, roaring at the top of his lungs. he is followed by legolas and gimli. surprised orc reaction to the three charging towards thousands of orcs. the orcs scream at the sight of 5000 spectral warriors. the spectral warriors swarm into the flank of the qrc army. with a raging blood-lust, the undead climb over the top of each other to try and reach the enemy, creating a kind of.rolling mountain of ghouls that sweep all before them away. the orcs have no defence as their weapons cannot make contact with the ghosts. merry on the ground he looks around to see the witch-king standing over eowyn, pulling her to her feet. merry driving his sword into the back of the witch- king\\'s knee. merry\\'s sword bursts into flame and his arm is. shot with pain. eowyn struggles to her feet pulling off her helmet eowyn her long hair tumbling onto her shoulders. with her last strength, eowyn thrusts her sword into the witch-king\\'s face. eowyn\\'s sword shatters into many shards. the witch-king topples back dead, a black ooze leaking from his robes and armour. a shuddering cry, fading into a shrill wail passes with the wind. the mumakil react with terror as spectral warriors climb up their sides, routing the haradrim from their war-towers. orcs flee in their thousands the terrified mumakil trampling them in their panic to escape. the army of the dead swarming over the city, routing the orcs. eowyn crawls to where theoden lays, mortally wounded. theoden looks up at eowyn his breathing shallow his vision clouded. eowyn smiles down at him as she gently strokes his face. theoden touches her tear-stained face. theoden dies eowyn breaks down, sobbing all around is a vista of defeat. pelennor fields strangely silent all orcs have fled battle debris and bodies stretch as far as the eye can see. above minas tirith blinding sun rays break through the low clouds. gandalf, legolas, gimli and pippin watch as aragorn walks slowly across the field of battle towards the hideous ghouls. the army of the dead slowly dissolve into dust, and are immediately swept away by the four winds. aragorn turns to gandalf who bows his head in homage. pippin running through the ruin of the battle towards a small figure slumped on the ground. merry stares unseeing at pippin horror and shock erasing all other memories from merry\\'s mind tears fall down pippin\\'s face as he looks on his friend. pippin covers merry with a blanket. camera rises towards the dark orc tower of cirith ungol. a light glows from the topmost window. camera reaches the tower, dissolving through the wall into. a small cold room. frodo baggins is unconscious on the floor. his eyes suddenly flicker and he wakes up. angle on frodo as he realizes that he has been stripped down to his underwear. he clutches at his throat. the ring has gone. gorbag grabs for the mithril vest. gorbag draws his sword, but shagrat kicks him backwards with his foot. gorbag falls through a trap door leading to the floor below. gorbag lands in the guard room with a crash, creating sudden alarm amongst the orcs and uruk-hai stationed there. shagrat leans through the trap door. the dead uruk-hai topples backwards over the parapet. landing on top of uruk-hai and orcs in the courtyard below. within moments, a brutal civil war breaks out between the two companies stationed in cirith ungol. sam hurries towards the gate, fearful for frodo. sam is confronted with the sight of over 50 slaughtered orc and uruk-hai, strewn over the courtyard. sam pounds up the staircase he suddenly pauses. several uruk-hai are running down towards him. he grips sting and continues charging up - screaming at the top of his lungs. the four uruks they see a huge distorted shadow on the wall in front of them. they turn around and flee in terror back to the top of the stairs. sam appears - and before the uruk-hai can fully regain their wits - he slays three yelling frodo struggling against his bonds, as gorbag climbs back into the room with vengeance in his evil eyes. gorbag grabs frodo\\'s hair and pulls his head back, exposing his neck. he pulls out his sword, ready to cut frodo\\'s throat. suddenly. gorbag gasps as sting is rammed into his back by sam. gorbag falls dead. frodo humbled by sam\\'s unswerving loyalty. sam quickly cuts frodo free. sam pulls the ring from his pocket. frodo looks at sam amazed his eyes drop to the rn ig sam hesitates tension instantly builds between them. sam seems strangely reluctant on the soundtrack to hum of the ring builds sam drops the ring into frodo\\'s palm. frodo sags in relief he puts the ring back around his nc . ek frodo looks at sam, pain in his eyes. sam looks down at frodo his plain hobbit face full of compassion. sam\\'s resolve hardens, a new strength takes hold. frodo and sam are now dressed in foul-looking orc gear. frodo and sam turn east and walk over the summit of cirith ungol into mordor. frodo and sam they stop dead staring ahead mount doom 50 m,iles away - across the barren gorgoroth plateau - the mountain is erupting streams of ash and lava high into the air, lighting the low cloud blanket of mordor with a flickering orange wash. with immense trepidation, frodo and sam head down the steep path into the dark kingdom. two tiny figures in a bleak, foreboding landscape. before them lies the plain of gorgoroth their eyes are drawn to the ominous silhouette of mount doom. frodo\\'s eyes travel down towards the hundreds of fires which glow on the plains beneath them thousands upon thousands of orcs are encamped there . their eyes are drawn to a dark looming shape barad-dur a red light seems to sweep across the plain. sam cannot see what frodo sees. gently, he urges frodo on. gandalf stands in the tower hall seemingly alone he speaks quietly, doubt and fear edge his voice. he turns and crosses the hall to reveal the presence of gimli, legolas, eomer and aragorn. aragorn, his back to gandalf. gandalf - still troubled, still worried. gimli sits insolently on the seat of the steward. gandalf looks across at the dwarf his face ashen. aragorn turns around suddenly. gandalf looks up sharply at aragorn. at this, gimli chokes on his pipe eomer steps forward. gandalf speaks in a low tone to aragorn. aragorn wearing a breast plate emblazoned with the white tree. he rides at the head of a column of 500 foot soldiers from rohan and condor leading them from the ruins of osgiliath. gandalf, legolas, gimli, eomer, merry and pippin ride directly behind him. ahead of them the mountains of mordor. great armies of orc and uruk-hai stream across the plains from mordor. the volcanic wasteland of the gorgoroth foothills. frodo and sam, still disguised in the orc armour, slide down scree bank and land on the road below their attention is fixed on the plain below thousands of orcs can be seen marching away from mt. doom. frodo and sam moving across a hellish dry landscape of twisted volcanic rock and steaming fissures. 40 miles away, mount doom rises out of the plain its feet founded in ashen ruin, its huge cone rising to a great height, where its reeking head is swathed in cloud. aragorn\\'s force of 500 approaches the great black gates of mordor. he positions his troops about half a mile from the gates. frodo slumped against a rock he tries to drink from his water bottle but finds it empty. frodo gratefully takes a small sip from sam\\'s bottle hands it back. a moment of eye contact between frodo and sam as they acknowledge what lies ahead. sam offers frodo his hand and pulls him up. at the black gates, aragorn musters his men. frodo and sam staggering across the tortured landscape they are no longer wearing the orc armour. frodo is walking half-bowed, often stumbling as if his eyes not longer see the way before his feet. his right hand is pressed against his chest supporting a heavy weight. his left hand often rises, as if to ward off some invisible blow. sam watches him, concern etched across his face. frodo as a malevolent voice in his head calls to him \"baggins - baggins\". sam looking behind him in time to see. a ray of red light stabs through the gloom and begins to sweep over the barren landscape. sam throws himself to the ground frodo turns to the light, unable to stop himself. frodo crumpling to the ground as the red light hits him like a searchlight. all is quiet no sign of the enemy. gandalf watchful alert. he nods at aragorn. aragorn, gandalf, legolas, gimli, eomer, merry and pippin galloping towards the black gates. they pull up less than 50 yards from the towering gates. frodo is slumped on the ground, unable to move. aragorn moves his horse forward. from behind the huge gates, the terrifying chanting and the clanging of the armour of thousands. with the sound of tortured metal, the massive gates begin to open legolas, merry and eomer look on in trepidation. with the eye of sauron sweeping the plains around them, sam gets to his feet. the black gates of mordor swing open. sauron\\'s army of 300,000 orcs march out. aragorn, gandalf, legolas, gimli, eomer, merry and pippin gallop back towards their small army as the orc masses slowly march toward them. behind them, the eye of sauron is directed toward them. frodo\\'s eyes open with a start. sam crawls toward frodo. frodo and sam stagger to their feet and move off. the massive orc army marching towards aragorn\\'s men. aragorn\\'s men starting to waver as the orcs encircle them. some men are backing away losing their nerve. aragorn gallops in front of his army. aragorn he seems to fix each and everyone of his men with his eyes. aragorn holds anduril aloft. frodo and sam are climbing the face of mount doom. the landscape is violent red heat hisses out of fissures, the rock is jagged razor sharp ash blankets the land. red lightning forks across the sky with a deafening crack. frodo and sam\\'s feet dragging across the ash their parched lips sweating, dusty faces. frodo trips falls face-first into the dust sam drops beside him. of aragorn\\'s army, totally surrounded by 300,000 orcs poised for the order to attack. frodo slowly lifts his head and looks up. frodo\\'s looking .straight up the steep slopes of mount doom a huge mass of ash and slag and burned stone. frodo starts to crawl on his hands and knees. he hauls himself a few pitiful feet before slumping in the ash. gimli as he surveys the army of mordor. gimli looks up into the eyes of legolas, with whom he has shared so much. the gruff dwarf smiles quietly. legolas drops his hand on gimli\\'s shoulder slowly they turn and face the enemy together. sam crawls to frodo who lies slumped against the rock-face he turns him over, holding him in his arms. frodo shuts his eyes, his breath coming in gasps. with that, sam lifts frodo on to his shoulders and starts to climb mount doom. his plain hobbit-face grows stern, almost grim, as the will hardens in him. two tiny hobbits on the endless shale slopes of the mountain. aragorn and company watch as they are surrounded by a tide of orcs. aragorn raises anduril in the broad sweep as he walks forward he turns to face the others. quiet resolve written on aragorn\\'s face as he looks into the eyes of the remaining members of the fellowship. aragorn turning, sword-raised, he charges forward. there is a moment of silence no-one else moves suddenly a shout goes up. pippin and merry charging forward the rest of the men following. aragorn crashing head on into a line of orcs. the blade of anduril flashing as aragorn hacks at orcs. like a small grey insect, sam creeps up the slope with frodo on his back foot by foot. the mantling cloud swirls, revealing the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of barad-dur, the dark tower, in the distance. sam staggering under frodo\\'s weight strong ash- laden winds are buffeting him as he slowly climbs mount doom. the plain of gorgoroth lies 1000 feet below, wrapped in fume and shadow. a tremor ripples through the ground a red flame explodes into the sky. sam looks up - fearful the mountain could explode at any moment. through the thick, fume-laden air a set of stairs can be made out. sam can\\'t believe it - relief and joy flood through him. smack out of nowhere the figure of smeagol crashes into them sending sam and frodo sprawling. smeagol pounces on frodo his fingers wrapping around his throat, snapping frodo\\'s neck from side to side. frodo as he struggles to unlock the bony, white fingers around his neck but smeagol\\'s grip is too strong. smeagol\\'s fingers tightening around frodo\\'s neck - squeezing the life out of him. frodo comes to. the battle between men and orcs rages on from mordor, high overhead, the nazgul fly out into the fray. all the old hatred between sam and smeagol boils over as they fight sam falls back smeagol biting at his shoulder. sam pushes smeagol away with his feet rolls to his knees, as smeagol charges at him. sam slashes out with sting. he cuts smeagol across the stomach. smeagol staggers back, screaming with pain. sam looks around desperately for frodo. frodo has gone. frodo running up the mountain. fellowship fight bravely a hideous screech rends the air. gandalf looks up to a nazgul diving straight toward him. gandalf eyes flicker as a small moth flutters across his line of sight. another cry rends the air as. smack. the giant eagle, gwahir, smashes into the fellbeast, it\\'s claws ripping into the hideous monster\\'s neck. pippin in the midst of battle looks up. above the battle attack formation, more eagles appear. pippin (cont\\'d) the eagles are coming. the eagles are coming. the eagles engage the nazgul. sam is gasping, his lungs exploding as he races up the slopes of mount doom searching for frodo. sam arriving at the stone doorway of sammath naur leading into the mountain. sam staggers into it. sam flinches against the fierce heat blasting down the tunnel. sam lurches forward towards an orange glow deep in the heart of the mountain. the heat is almost unbearable sam sees frodo in the distance. frodo is standing on the edge of the crack of doom a deep lava filled chasm, in the very heart of ancient sauron\\'s forges, the greatest in middle-earth. the raging orange glare from the chasm turns frodo into a black silhouette standing tense and still. frodo holds the ring in his hand he raises it, holding it over the bubbling lava far below.- frodo a strange expression on his face. the hum of the ring grows louder and louder. frodo pulls the ring close to his body as he turns to sam. frodo looks at sam, the ring has finally taken him. sam screams as. frodo puts the ring on. he vanishes. with a storm of wings, the nazgul wheel around and hurtle towards mount doom. in the midst of the battle - gandalf realising frodo has been seen. sam is screaming for frodo. footprints moving across the ash covered cavern floor. suddenly. gollum smashes a rock down on sam\\'s head, knocking him to the ground. gollum leaps on to the invisible frodo. frodo\\'s footprints staggering about under gollum\\'s weight. gollum clawing frantically, riding on the back of the invisible frodo. aragorn turns and is confronted by an armoured troll, wielding an enormous mallet. gollum suddenly lifts his hands to his face and bites hard. frodo materializes as he drops to his knees, clutching his bleeding hand he screams. legolas as aragorn falls to the ground. gollum triumphantly holds the ring aloft ecstatic. gollum dancing gleefully perilously close to the edge of the chasm. aragorn turns to see huge troll feet moving closer legolas races toward him. gollum still triumphant on the edge of the precipice the fiery lava casting an evil light he jumps about in delight. frodo rises slowly his eyes lock on gollum time seems to stand still as each regards the other. the ring glinting in gollum\\'s hand beautiful powerful evil. suddenly. frodo lunges at gollum. frodo thuds into gollum, lifting him off his feet. thud. the huge foot of the cave troll lands on aragorn\\'s chest. he stabs at. it ineffectually. gandalf in despair. sam watches in horror as frodo and gollum disappear into the chasm. he staggers over. gollum falls into the crack of doom instantly engulfed in the churning lava. sam leans into the crack of doom. frodo clinging onto the rock face with his one good hand. the caverns are shaking violently. sam desperately reaches for him frodo is too far down. frodo looks at sam, his face impassive. frodo struggles to reach sam he.can\\'t reach with his bleeding hand, and falls\\'back, still clinging valiantly to the rock with his good hand. frodo looks at sam imploringly. frodo reaches up once more and this time sam grasps his hand tightly . the ring sits on the river of lava for a brief moment, then sinks away. the eye of sauron. across the great plains - mount doom is clearly imploding. on the battlefield, all eyes turn to mount doom. the cave troll, with aragorn at his mercy, is distracted by the sounds emanating from mordor he turns in terror and runs off. the fellowship turn to watch as the massive dark tower of sauron shakes itself to pieces. towers fall and walls crumble vast spires of smoke and spouting steam billow up. the foundations explode apart. the black gates collapse in a huge cloud of ash. the company watch as mount doom explodes the reason for their misery is clear it\\'s plain frodo and sam can never survive the cataclysm. the volcano is erupting, fire belches from it\\'s riven summit, sending lava streaming down it\\'s sides. frodo and sam stagger out of the sammath naur door all around ash and molten rocks fall. the skies burst into thunder, seared with lightning. the screaming nazgul fall from the sky in flames. the ground is shaking so violently that frodo and sam can barely stand. frodo stumbles sam helps him up frodo smiles. sam looks down at frodo frodo\\'s face is at peace his burden destroyed. frodo and sam crawl onto a rock as lava streams towards them in seconds their rock is an island in a sea of molten fire. ,\\' . frodo shuts his eyes. frodo glances at sam he is weeping. frodo wrapping an arm around sam\\'s shoulder. two tiny hobbits waiting to die amid a cataclysmic landscape lava erupts around them fireballs rain down from the sky. gwaihir, the great eagle flaps towards camera he bears gandalf on his back, and is followed by two more eagles. wide shot the eagles bravely fly amid the raining ash and molten rocks and snatch frodo and sam from the rock. frodo\\'s face as the fiery volcano recedes away beneath him the wind ruffles his hair he passes out. frodo\\'s eyes flutter open looking around slowly his eyes alight on gandalf. as merry and pippin run in jumping on the bed and hugging frodo. gimli and legolas enter the room their joy is plain. aragorn joins them - the fellowship is complete. finally frodo\\'s eyes fall upon a figure standing apart from the others it is sam. frodo\\'s and sam\\'s eyes meet. sweeping over the minas tirith walls, racing towards the top of the city through a blizzard of white flower petals. minas tirith is restored it gleams white in the bright sun. to reveal the court of the kings, crowded with 4000 people cramming the wide path leading to the tower hall. the crown of condor glints in the brilliant sunshine. gandalf places the crown upon aragorn\\'s head. aragorn smiles up at gandalf. aragorn slowly rises, turning to face the crowd, who cheer and clap for their king. the cheers of his people are deafening. aragorn sings for his people then walks in slow procession down the white paved path as the crowd bow their heads in respect to their new king. aragorn passes eowyn and faramir who bow before him eomer steps forward to bow in respect. trumpets sound as a procession of elves, dressed in shimmering silvers and whites, led by legolas approach the king legolas gestures behind him. aragorn\\'s eyes scan amongst the elves a banner carried aloft bearing the white tree of condor in full flower the ranks of elves part revealing arwen, eyes shining mortal now, but deeply in love carrying the standard of condor aragorn kisses her elrond looks on his face breaks into a smile. aragorn and arwen embrace. aragorn and arwen walking through the crowd towards four small figures who stand nervously at the end of the avenue. aragorn and arwen look on frodo, sam, merry and pippin, as they stand before them. the four hobbits, dressed in their old clothes, clean and mended, bow their heads. aragorn raises his hand. tears spring into frodo\\'s eyes. he clutches sam\\'s shoulder as 4000 people pay homage to the courage of two little hobbits from the shire. camera rises into the air away from the crowded citadel, until minas tirith becomes a speck in the landscape. dissolving into the parchment map of middle-earth slowly drifting across the map towards the west. revealing hobbiton bathed in a warm sunset as frodo, sam, merry and pippin ride into shot on ponies past odo proudfoot who shakes his head at the strangeness of their appearance. frodo brings a round of drinks to the table. the four friends look at each other. a world of experience now separates from their fellow hobbits. seated at a long table, the four friends raise their glasses sam eye is suddenly caught. rosie cotton who is serving behind the bar. sam steels himself and leaves to go and talk to rosie. frodo, merry and pippin exchange smiles as. on a beautiful sunny day, sam and rosie are married with their dearest friends gathered around them. rosie throws a beautiful bouquet of flowers it\\'s caught by pippin who smiles in embarrassment. frodo walks through bag end to his study. frodo from behind. he is hunched over a desk. frodo winces with a sharp gasp of pain he puts the pen down and clutches at his shoulder. sam has entered the room and stands behind frodo. frodo he is drawn and pale. sam at a loss for words. his eyes fall to the book \\' to frodo\\'s handwriting lyrical music over. a cold winter\\'s morning out of the fog rattles a small covered wagon gandalf is at the reins. frodo, sam, merry and pippin are waiting on ponies for the wagon all are wearing their grey elven robes. gandalf arrives in his cart. the wagon trundles along at a sedate pace. sam, merry and pippin ride behind, leading frodo\\'s empty pony. frodo is sitting in the wagon his arm around his uncle bilbo. bilbo is extremely old and frail. he is dozing his head slumped. bilbo nods back to sleep frodo rests his head against him. frodo, walking arm-in-arm with bilbo through a beautiful elven boat-house gandalf follows with merry, pippin and sam. as bilbo looks up, he is stung by the beauty before hm i passing under a beautiful elven archway. to reveal a white ship, ready to depart from a white stone dock. elrond, celeborn and galadriel are waiting for them. bilbo bows in acknowledgement to elrond, celeborn and galadriel, who return his greeting. bilbo walks down toward the boat and boards with elrond. frodo looks up galadriel is watching him. she smiles, turns and boards the boat. gandalf kneels before sam, merry and pippin - who are all looking tearful. there is great sadness merry sniffles loudly. gandalf looks at frodo then turns and slowly walks towards the gangplank to board the ship. frodo turns to sam. sam looks down frodo is holding bilbo\\'s red journal out towards him. sam is sobbing merry and pippin are distraught. frodo hugs merry and pippin, and last of all sam and climbs on board the ship. frodo a look of wonderment crosses his face as he steps forward and accepts gandalf\\'s hand finally released from his pain, care falls from his face he is the young frodo we first met so long ago. sam, merry and pippin comfort each other as the white ship glides away from the dock. sam walks up the path towards his house. a little girl toddles up to greet him. he hugs his daughter. rosie cotton steps up and kisses sam on the cheek she gives him a tiny baby boy to cradle. sam with his family he draws a deep breath sam looks at his lovely family with great happiness, tinged with a little sadness. sam and

ladle. three rings, each set with a single gem, are received by the high elves-galadriel, gil-galad and cirdan. seven rings held aloft in triumph by the dwarf lords. nine rings clutched tightly by the kings of men as if holding-close a precious secret. an ancient parchment map of middle earth moving slowly across the map as if drawn by an unseen force the camera closes in on a place name mordor. sauron forging the one ring in the chambers of sammath naur. the one ring falls through space and into flames. a great shadow falls across the map closing in around the realm of gondor. screaming

his finger. ripples of light play across isildur\\'s pale face he is dead. the ring falls through the murky waters of the river anduin. the waters of the anduin river lie dark and undisturbed. silt

shadowy outline of an emaciated figure. bathed in cold moonlight, the world lies dark and still the unsettled quiet before the storm. unseen by its keeper the ring falls to the muddy floor of a mountain tunnel. fumbling in the dark, a small hand closes over the ring. a youngish looking bilbo baggins peers down at what lies in his hand perplexed by what he has found. suddenly. a voice screams its anguish ringing through the cold, dank tunnels. frightened bilbo quickly pockets the one ring and hurries on. the camera soars away from the mountains. moving faster and faster their dark green forests and jagged white peaks receding into the shroud of mist two hobbit feet resting on a small rock rising out of the long, overgrown grasses a figure lies beneath the dappled sunlight of an old tree. white flowers are scattered among the well seeded grasses. an idyllic setting at the end of a long hot summer the figure is reading a book. in the distance, growing louder over the gentle clip clop of an approaching cart and horse can be heard the humming of a deep voice to the tune of \"the road goes ever on and on \" suddenly. the figure in the grass sits up looking straight at camera is a handsome young hobbit, with dark curly hair and deep blue eyes. this is frodo baggins his eyes alight with excitement. tossing away the long stem of grass in his mouth, frodo runs off. the cart rattles along a leafy lane, driven by a stooped figure in grey. intercut with shots of frodo running careering down a hill jumping over logs dodging tree branches. the shambling old pony snorts and rears as suddenly frodo appears on a bank above the cart. gandalf glowers at the young hobbit. they look at each other a moment then both start laughing as frodo\\'s face breaks into a smile and he leaps on to the front seat of the cart. next to gandalf, we see how small hobbits are frodo is 3 foot 6 inches tall. the cart rattles past a field lupin being tended by hobbits. gandalf looks down at frodo, a twinkle in his eye. the cart rattles over a stone bridge towards a busy hobbit marketplace. gandalf as he surveys the peaceful scene before him. hobbits look up exclaiming in wonder and excitement as the cart bearing gandalf and frodo rolls past the green dragon inn towards the party field. where scorcs of hobbits are busy preparing for the big night. frodo shoots a knowing look, as gandalf averts his eyes. odo proudfoot looks up as the cart passes by, deeply suspicious. as the cart rattles into the small village of hobbiton a quaint rustic settlement, nestled amongst rolling green hills and large trees. the hobbits live in hobbit holes neat burrows dug into the grassy hillside, with round doors and cute front gardens. excited children, chasing after the cart. gandalf ignorcs the children\\'s cries. the children stand deflated, watching gandalf disappear up the lane. at that moment spinning balls of bright color suddenly leap out of the cart, fizzing over the heads of the delighted children. gandalf smiling to himself, well pleased with his joke. odo proudfoot is unable to suppress a chuckle. frodo stands up in the cart as gandalf reigns in the horse. gandalf\\'s cart pulls up outside the gate to bag end a particularly fine example of a hobbit hole, with a large round front door set into a grassy hillside. there is a sign on the gate which reads \"no admittance except on party business.\" gandalf strides up to the garden path of bag end. he raises his staff and raps on the front door a voice calls out suddenly the door opens and bilbo baggins stands before him. he is a hobbit of indertiminate age, with a mischievous twinkle in his eye. wearing a dashing brocade waist coat, he looks every inch the eccentric gentleman. gandalf drops to his knee to embrace his old friend. gandalf looks at him more keenly. bilbo leads gandalf into bag end cozy and cluttered with souvenirs of bilbo\\'s travels. gandalf has to stoop to avoid hitting his head on the low ceiling. bilbo hangs up gandalf\\'s hat on a peg and trots off down the hall. bilbo disappears into the kitchen as gandalf looks around enjoying the familiarity of bag end he turns, knocking his head on the light and then walking into the wooden beam. he groans. gandalf stops in front of a framed map, charred in one corner it is thorin\\'s map of the lonely mountain, gandalf smiles to himself. bilbo jumps, a half eaten pork pie in his hand, as gandalf mysteriously appears behind him. bilbo baggins, you open this door i know you\\'re in there. gandalf watches, amused as bilbo tries to hide. bilbo\\'s fingers close around his waistcoat pocket gripping a small, unseen object. gandalf and bilbo are sitting on the bag end porch. below them, final preparations are being made on the party field. bilbo strikes a match and lights his pipe. bilbo blows a perfect smoke ring and watches it rise into the air. a tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through the center of bilbo\\'s smoke ring. boom. a firework explodes into the night sky high above hobbiton in the shape of a great green tree with unfolding branches. with glowing flowers as they rain down from the branches evaporating just above the up turned faces of the delighted party-goers 144 hobbits, feasting and drinking carts of beer and wine are scattered about, and the tables are piled high with steaming scones and savories. gandalf hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark that dances magically from his staff bilbo is greeting visitors. frodo and sam sit at a table drinking ale frodo notices sam\\'s eyes keep flicking to another pretty hobbit, rosie cotton, sitting some distance away. sam goes to drain his glass suddenly it is snatched out of his hands as frodo thrusts him into the middle of a passing throng of dancers. sam\\'s horrified face as he is swept away. frodo laughs and finishes sam\\'s beer. gandalf as he sets alight a particularly spectacular firework that draws gasps of admiration from the party guests. bilbo is relating stories of his adventure to a group of young hobbit children. a little hobbit girl\\'s upturned face her eyes growing larger and larger. stunned gasps from his young audience greet his astonishing feat. merry and pippin, two mischievous young hobbits in their late teens. pippin scrambles on to the back of gandalf\\'s wagon, snatching up a small firework merry is holding out the big rocket he looks aghast at the fizzing fuse that pippin has just lit. merry fearfully tosses the rocket to pippin. the fuse sizzles angrily. pippin attempts to throw the fizzing rocket back to merry. whoosh. the two hobbits are suddenly blown off their feet in a shower of sparks as the rocket blasts off with frightening power. the rocket zooms over the party it suddenly bursts apart, forming the shape of a great red golden dragon. fire gushes from its nostrils as it turns back and flies low towards the startled crowd. frodo watches the fireworks dragon with alarm but bilbo is oblivious to the panicking crowd and impending danger. frodo as he hurriedly pulls bilbo to the ground, just as the dragon roars a few feet above their heads like a flaming express train. hobbits dive to the ground, tables overturn, tents collapse, food flies everywhere. the fireworks dragon turns a somersault and explodes over the hills with a deafening bang. this gets the biggest cheer of the night. merry and pippin, clothes and hair smoking. large hands suddenly clamp down on merry and pippin\\'s ears. gandalf looking down sternly. merry and pippin are leaning over a barrel, washing dishes in soapy water with gandalf sitting nearby, smoking his pipe and sipping an ale. cries of \"speech. speech\" erupt from the party. bilbo stepping on a stool he bows in gratitude at the applause. a hobbit with particularly big feet scattered clapping as the guests try to work out if that was a compliment or not. frodo and gandalf smiling to themselves. bilbo a strange hum seems to fill his head. a bead of sweat rolls down his brow. bilbo\\'s hand pulls something out of his waistcoat pocket and holds it behind his back. bilbo instantly vanishes. the party explodes into an uproar the crowd leaps to its feet. frodo staring at the empty stool in disbelief. the party is still in an excited uproar some 50 yards away as we pan across a moonlit lane to the front door of bag end. door opens, pulled by an invisible hand. the door quietly closes bilbo materializes as he pulls a plain gold ring off his finger. bilbo laughs as he tosses the ring in the air, then places it in his pocket. bilbo emerges from the passage, carrying a walking stick. he finds gandalf looming over him. bilbo he gives gandalf a look and nods toward the mantelpiece. gandalf looks down at bilbo with rising concern. gandalf rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadow suddenly seems to fill the room bilbo lifts his knapsack and heads for the front door. bilbo hesitates reaches into his pocket. bilbo pulls out the ring he stares at it in his palm. with all his will power, bilbo allows the ring to slowly slide off his palm and drop to the floor. the tiny ring lands with a heavy thud on the wooden floor. bilbo staggering out of bag end he braces himself in the night air, pale and trembling, as if his loss of the ring has weakened him. gandalf steps up behind. bilbo walks away from bag end, disappearing into the night, softly singing \"the road goes on and on.\" the ring glinting on the floor gandalf circles around it, a puzzled look on his face. gandalf slowly reaches for the ring. his fingers barely touch the ring the creepy hum rises on the soundtrack. gandalf is sitting in front of the fire, with his pipe staring into the flickering flames. frodo rushes into bag end he stops and picks up the ring at his feet. gandalf continues staring into the fire, as if locked in thought. gandalf turns his eyes locking onto the ring in frodo\\'s fingers. gandalf sorts hurriedly through bilbo\\'s papers. gandalf holds out the envelope frodo drops the ring into it. gandolf seals the envelope with wax. he hands it to frodo. gandalf is already at the door, he turns to frodo. gandalf hurries out the door leaving frodo standing alone in the bag end. the envelope the camera pushes in the hum of the ring comes up on the soundtrack. the camera pushes through the white paper to the ring beneath the hum the whispered murmur of black speech can be heard. the jagged ruins of\" barad-dur. the dark tower. teasing the huge dark tower of barad-dur is being rebuilt. thousands of orcs crawl over the surface, hauling stone and iron up the towering heights. mount doom a huge, billowing cloud of black filth grows and spreads across the red

door. creepy pov from inside bag end frodo coming up the path. frodo enters bag end he immediately pauses, sensing that something is amiss. all is quiet frodo peers uneasily into the darkened living room. suddenly. a large figure looms out of the shadows, reaching for frodo. frodo lets out a startled cry, pulls himself free and spins around to face his assailant. gandalf steps into a shaft of moonlight. paranoia blazes in his eyes. his clothes are dirty and ragged from much traveling. hair and beard much longer an unkempt. frodo pulls the envelope out of an old chest. gandalf, suspicious, alert. without a word, gandalf takes the envelope and tosses it into the fireplace. flames instantly consume the envelope revealing the ring, as it sinks into the red hot embers. gandalf reaches into the fire with a pair of tongs he lifts the ring out. gandalf drops the ring into frodo\\'s hand he reacts to its weight. gandalf still tense mordor? in the common tongue it says, \"one ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them.\" the ring lies on frodo\\'s simple kitchen table. frodo stunned emanates from the ring. frodo looks at gandalf, each knowing the other has heard it. the ring lies between them on the table. frodo hurriedly entering the living room. gandalf looks at frodo, sadly. a teasing glimpse of gollum being

continue their journey. gandalf is galloping along the outskirts of the ancient forest of fangorn. nestled in a basin at the foot of the distant misty mountains, the tall black tower of orthanc is clearly visible gandalf gallops through the gate, into the fortress of isengard a great ring-wall of stone, a mile from rim to rim, encloses beautiful trees and gardens, watered by streams that flow down from the mountains. the strange tower of orthanc hewn from a solid pillar of black obsidian rises up in the center of the isengard circle. gandalf arrives at the foot of the orthanc stairs. saruman, the white wizard he sweeps down the orthanc stairs. gandalf moves quickly towards him, grimy and weary from his long ride. gandalf and saruman walk slowly between the beautiful trees of isengard, saruman\\'s clean, white robe contrasts with gandalf\\'s dusty grey robes. saruman and gandalf are seated in a small, cluttered room to the side of the cavernous central chamber. gandalf and saruman stride through orthanc toward a stone plinth on which a sphere like shape is draped with a cloth. saruman lifts the cloth to reveal the palantir. flash a fiery eye. saruman sits upon his throne. gandalf backs away and turns to run to the door horrified as the doors suddenly slam shut. gandalf slowly turns to saruman a look of dawning horror. at that moment gandalf is suddenly blasted across the room. he slams against the wall pinned there by some unseen force. with sudden effort, gandalf wrenches himself off the wall and swings his staff on saruman blasting him off his feet. gandalf and saruman battle, powerful blasts throwing them across the room. saruman screams, eyes blazing. gandalf\\'s staff is suddenly wrenched from his grasp it flies across the chamber into saruman\\'s hand. gandalf is flung to the floor. gandalf is breathing hard on the floor, his eyes look into the madness of saruman commanding two staffs, saruman sends gandalf into a sickening spin. gandalf tumbles towards the top of the chamber as if falling in reverse. the roof of orthanc rockets toward camera. frodo and sam walking along a country lane which borders farmer maggot\\'s fields. sam is looking up frodo has disappeared around a corner in the lane. merry, pippin, and frodo picking themselves up a variety of vegetables have scattered everywhere. merry gives sam a large cabbage. a large pitchfork can be seen racing towards them along the hedgerow angry shouts from farmer maggot. merry and pippin hurriedly gather their booty and race away with frodo and sam on their heels. the baying of large dogs sounds. frodo, sam, and merry and pippin tumble head over heels down a bank, onto a dark, wooded road. a winded pippin, his face inches away from a large pile of horse droppings. frodo picks himself up and looks around quickly. pulls a large carrot, almost broken through in the middle, out from his back pocket. pippin has spied something under the trees on the far side of the road. small, brown mushrooms growing amongst the loamy undergrowth. sam, merry, and pippin race toward the mushrooms. frodo is tense and watchful. he realizes they are on a wooded road. scattered leaves rise into the air whirling down the road as if blown by an invisible wind. suddenly the sound of horses hooves. a long drawn wail comes down the wind, like the cry of some evil and lonely creature. sam grabs merry and pippin as the hobbits quickly scramble down the bank, hiding under a mossy log. the sound of hooves is close a sinister mounted ringwrath steps into view hooded and faceless, mounted on a huge snarling black horse with insane eyes . frodo freezes in terror. the ringwraith pauses right beside their hiding place he sits very still with his head bowed, listening. from inside the hood comes a sniffing noise as if he is trying to catch an elusive scent his head turning from side to side. frodo beads of sweat gather on his brow. the ringwraith suddenly slides off his horse, leaning over the mossy log, peering suspiciously into the woods. frodo he is drawing the ring out of his pocket, with trembling hands his face fevered and sweating as if in the grip of some terrible internal struggle. the sound of sniffing intensifies as the ringwraith darts his head from side to side like a bird of party. frodo squeezing his eyes shut. quick psychic blasts. and evil dark tower a great eye a burst of flame. sam looking at frodo with concern merry desperately hurls the mushrooms across the road the ringwraith spins around at the sound, and darts to the far side of the road with frightening speed. frodo instantly slumps as if a psychic link had been broken frodo is staring, a look of shock on his face at the ring lying in the palm of his hand. frodo, sam, merry, and pippin hurry through the trees slipping and sliding on the muddy ground. merry moves past pippin, toward frodo, watching intently sam keeps looking around nervously. the silhouette of a black rider looms against the skyline. the four hobbits sprawled on the ground, holding their breath. the black rider turns and departs. merry looks at his friend realizing frodo is in deep trouble. the hobbits break cover. suddenly, a ringwraith bursts out of the forest toward them. the hobbits run the ringwraith shrieks. frodo, sam, merry and pippin, are running towards the wide, placid brandywine river and the ferry. stomping hooves snarling horses. four ringwraiths are speeding through the fog converging on the ferry crossing. the hobbits stampede across the wharf and tumble onto the ferry. frodo races across the wooden wharf, followed by the ringwraiths. he leaps into the ferry. hooves thunder down the wooden wharf. sam and merry shove off with the poles the ferry slides out into the river, just as the ringwraiths arrive. they pull up on the end of the wharf shrieking with rage. the hobbits cover their ears. the ringwraiths wheel their horses towards the north and gallop away along the river bank, quickly disappearing into the fog. lights of bree a small village of stone and half timbered houses nestled against a low wooded hill. a thick hedge surrounds the village a great gate bars the western entrance. frodo, sam, merry and pippin approaching the gatehouse wild eyes, ragged, and out of breath. a surly gatekeeper glances down at them. the gatekeeper swings his lantern onto the hobbits, bathing them in an uncomfortable yellow spotlight. the hobbits gratefully enter bree the gatekeeper eyeing them curiously in the lantern light. the tall bree folk loom over the nervous little hobbits as frodo, sam, merry and pippin make their way through the narrow streets. tall buildings tower above them lights glow dimly from behind thick curtains. the sign of the \"prancing pony inn\" frodo, sam, merry, and pippin hurry toward it. frodo, sam, merry and pippin come rushing in. frodo attracts the inn keepers\\'s attention. the noise, smokey inn. it is dimly lit, cheifly from a blazing log fire and crowded with a mixture of big folk, local hobbits, and a couple of dwarfs. frodo, sam, merry and pippin are sitting at a table against the wall clearly trying to remain quiet and inconspicuous sam can\\'t help himself he keeps casting nervous glances around. merry ploinks himself down at a table, carrying a very large mug of beer. sam watches pippin rise unsteadily to his feet and head to the bar. a couple of swarthy men leaning against the bar glance at frodo, then quickly look away. sam indicates a brooding stranger who sits alone at a table in the far corner, smoking a curiously carved long stemmed pipe, peering from beneath a travel stained cowl with gleaming eyes. frodo gestures to butterbur. beneath table frodo\\'s fingers are nervously toying with the ring. frodo sweat runs down his brow. the strange hum of the ring spills into the soundtrack. baggins baggins  a creepy whisper seems to fill frodo\\'s head sound that dissolves into pippin\\'s loud voice pippin sitting at the bar, chatting with locals. frodo leaps to his feet and pushes his way towards the bar. frodo grabs pippin\\'s sleeve, spilling his beer. pippin pushes frodo away he stumbles backwards, and falls to the floor. at that instant, the inn goes silent and all the attention turns to frodo. the ring in agonizing slow motion we watch as it seems to hang in the air for a split second then crashes down onto his out stretched finger. frodo vanishes. there is a sharp intake of breath followed by total silence. the ringwraiths turn sharply in their saddles instantly aware that the ring is being worn. they spur their horses towards the distant lights of bree. sam looks sick pippin instantly sobers, realizing his folly the brooding stranger frowns and the inn erupts into excited babble. frodo as he finds himself in the twilight world of the ring the excited crowd are suddenly moving in slow motion distorted voices a weird photographic negative quality. frodo is moving in real time against the slow motion background. he suddenly clutches his head as he is hit with quick images of a great eye. an evil cat-like eye, wreathed in flames. voice of sauron there is no life here in the void only cold only death frodo is terrified. he rolls under a table, desperately pulling the ring from his finger. frodo materializes into the real world. at that moment a large hand reaches under the table and grabs frodo by the collar, and drags him away. frodo is roughly pushed against the wall. the brooding stranger looms over him. frodo is pushed into the hobbit\\'s room by strider. the door bursts open and sam, merry and pippin appear on the doorway. sam is squaring off with is fists, merry brandishes a candlestick, and pippin a chair. strider sheaths his sword, a slight smile playing on his lips. the gate keeper comes out of his lodgings with a lantern a look of fear on his face. he approaches the closed gate with great apprehension. the

swords above the sleeping hobbits. sam\\'s eyes open wide. in unison, the ringwraits stab the hobbits, in a slashing, hacking frenzy. strider is grimly listening to the sounds from his room. the ringwraiths step back from the slashed beds in triumph. a hacked blanket is pulled back to reveal nothing but a shredded pillow. the ringwraiths shriek with rage sam sits up with a start. another shredded pillow is revealed. more shrieks of rage. pippin and merry wake with a start. sam, merry, and pippin have been sleeping on strider\\'s bed. frodo stands next to strider by the window, peering out nervously as furious ringwraith screeches echo across the courtyard from the hobbits room. strider looks from the window as the ringwraiths gallop down the bree streets. strider turns back to the hobbits, his face lit faintly by the glowing embers of the fire. strider, merry, pippin, and frodo march through a gloomy, overgrown forest. sam follows at the read leading \"bill\", a scrawny pony, who is laden with supplies. frodo watches uneasily as strider moves off into the cover of the trees. sam looks excited. strider leads the hobbits through the gloom of the forest. strider leading frodo, sam, merry, and pippin across the windswept moors. the hobbits suddenly stop and unstrap their knapsacks. strider stares at pippin blankly, then turns away, shaking his head. an apple is thrown to merry, who deftly catches it. another, aimed at pippin, catches him on the forehead. the hobbits trudge through rain, looking tired, hungry, and miserable. saruman stands over the palantir, his hands cupping the massive eye. black speech fills the room admist the harsh, guttural words the voice of saruman emerges. saruman is seated as his orc overseer approaches. gandalf lying unconscious on a cold obsidian floor. he wakes to the sound of ripping and tearing rising onto his knees lifting his head gandalf stands as the camera pulls back to reveal him stranded on the summit of orthanc. he is marooned on the tiny, flat peak, surrounded on all sides by a sheer 500 foot drop. another whispering wail rends the air. gandalf crosses quickly to the edge and peers down one of the beautiful isengard trees is being ripped from the ground by the orcs. gandalf looks on in horror as orcs hack into the trunk with axes. more and more trees are hauled down and killed as gandalf looks on in helpless despair. the rugged countryside as the hobbits journey on, lead by strider. strider stops before a distant hill, topped by an ancient ruin. frodo, merry, and pippin collapse into a small hollow, halfway up weathertop they are muddy and exhausted. stider drops 4 small swords at the hobbits feet. frodo eyes flickering open. he suddenly sits up, sniffing the air. sam, merry, and pippin

desperately towards the summit, clutching their swords. frodo, sam, merry, and pippin race into a ring of broken stones on the summit or weathertop the ruined base of an ancient tower. the hobbits stand back-to-back in the centre of the ring, waiting for the first assault one by one, the 5 ringwraiths appear brandishing gleaming swords, they move slowly towards the hobbits. in the center is their leader the witch king. sam rushes forward with a cry. he swings his sword at the witch king, who blocks the blow with his own sword. sam\\'s blade shatters the witch king lashes out with his fist, sending sam flying. merry and pippin, overcome with terror, throw themselves flat on the ground. the ringwraiths close in on frodo a venomous whisper dances in his head. frodo shuts his eyes and staggers back, desperately resisting the wraith\\'s whisperings slow motion as his hand goes into his pocket and pulls out the ring. the 5 ringwraiths utter a chilling screech of excitement. frodo is unable to resist any longer, falls to his knees and slips on the ring. he disappears. frodo finds himself in the weird twilight world he looks upon the ringwraiths, now visible in their true appearance five ghouls dressed in long grey robes, with white hair, and pallid, ruthless faces. the witch king extends a haggard hand towards frodo, reaching for the ring on his finger. frodo\\'s trembling hand extends forward as if by the pull of the ring he slides to the ground, unable to pull his hand away. the witch king snarls and springs forward. he stabs at frodo with a wicked dagger. frodo winces as the tip of the dagger sinks into his shoulder. suddenly, strider charges at the ringwraiths, wielding his sword in one hand, a flaming torch in the other. he moves in slow motion, visible through a sea of mist. frodo sinks to the ground. behind him is a faint image of a ringwraith fleeing, his head engulfed in flames. with draining strength, frodo manages to pull the ring off his finger.  appearing back in the real world, sam rushes over to him. another ringwraith is burning and screaming others screech fearfully at the flames, turn and flee form the weathertop summit. strider kneels before frodo. he snatches up the witch king\\'s dagger from the ground, staring gravely at the long, thin, blade. strider is jogging grimly, carrying an ailing frodo on his back. sam,

from deep underground. the camera is rising a small moth flutters into shot and leads the camera towards the summit or orthanc. gandalf lies slumped against the wall at the very top of orthanc, surrounded by a sheer 500 foot drop. he looks weak and frail and is seemingly asleep. the moth flutters close to gandalf. his hand suddenly moves at lighting speed and snatches the moth. gandalf brings his hand close to his face and opens it. the moth sits on the palm of his hand as gandalf mutter strange words in a foreign tongue. the moth\\'s face seemingly listening. it suddenly flutters away. camera follows the moth off the orthanc summit, but drops past the moth falling down, down, towards the pitted wasteland, straight into a fiery red tunnel. the dead trees of isengard are fed into roaring furnaces molten metal pours into casts red hot metal, beaten my sweating orc blacksmiths armor and weapons are forged from the great furnaces. saruman strides among the orcs and stands looking on a new born uruk-hai as it escapes its birthing membrane this is lurtz, who rises up to stand before his master. frodo his eyes flicker open clouded, red- rimmed his brow, beaded with sweat. a distant cry of a ringwraith carries through the air. frodo gasps in sudden pain. sam and strider desperately search the dark forest floor for the athelas plant. a small, white flowered plant. strider drops to one knee, carefully pulling it from the ground. suddenly. strider freezes as a sword blade touches his neck. strider slowly looks up. frodo is breathing hard, desperately ill. surreal impression a shimmering figure in white leaps off a horse. an ethereal vision of arwen, as she appears on the other side. arwen who now appears in her earth bound form, a young elven woman with tousled hair, dressed in mud-splattered riding clothes. arwen reaches for strider\\'s hand looking deep into his eyes. arwen mounts her horse, alsforth. arwen looks down at strider as she supports

different directions a total of 9 ringwraiths now pursuing frodo and arwen. panting head of the white elven horse. as the white horse races towards camera, to reveal the wide river bruinen in the foreground. without hesitation, the white horse leaps into the shallow water and thunders across the ford. the 9 ringwraiths pull up short of the ford, clearly nervous of the water. the white horse reaches the other side arwen pulls up and turns to defiantly face the ringwraiths from across the ford. the witch king screeches angrily, draws his sword, and leads the ringwraiths across the ford. the water starts flowing faster a distant rumble can be heard. arwen waits until they are halfway across she suddenly stands in the saddle arms raised. the ground suddenly trembles a mighty roar fills the air. frodo looks up weakly to see a vast torrent of water flooding down the river towards the ford as if a dam had burst. the foaming water seems to form the shape of dancing white horses with frothing manes. the ringwraiths scream in terror as they are swallowed up in the deluge. their piercing cries are drowned in the roaring of the river as it carries them away. frodo as he loses consciousness. arwen gathers the small hobbit in her arms, feeling his life slip away. delirious images and sounds. a bright light suddenly flares frodo squeezes his eyes shut, gasping. a familiar voice cuts through the swirl of sound. frodo\\'s eyes flicker open he is lying in bed next to an open window dappled sunlight plays on richly carved timbers the sound of a nearby waterfall drifts through the vista of fir trees. gandalf is sitting next to frodo\\'s bed. softly puffing on his pipe. he smiles at frodo. frodo sits up, looking at gandalf questioningly. gandalf troubled. his eyes drift away. saruman stands over gandalf, gloating. with the power of his staff, saruman raises gandalf from the ground, then sends him crashing to the floor. suddenly. gandalf lurches to his feet and throws himself off the tower. saruman watches gandalf fly away from isengard on the back of a giant eagle. gwaihir the eagle soars majestically over the mountains, carrying gandalf towards the dawn. frodo raises himself up and looks at gandalf. sam runs to frodo\\'s bedside. he is overjoyed to find frodo awake. bedside his face is neither old nor young, though in it is written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful. rivendell a small cluster of elegant elven buildings sitting in a shangri-la like valley below towering cliffs and snow capped mountains. frodo and sam walk together. suddenly, the voices of merry and pippin can be heard as they bound up to frodo and throw their arms around him. sam looks past frodo smiling a bent figure sits alone on a bench, in the sun. frodo turning, following sam\\'s gaze. bilbo baggins. he breaks in to a broad grin as frodo rushes forward to embrace him. bilbo has aged significantly since we last saw him. later frodo is turning the neatly inscribed title page of a red leather bound journal bilbo smiles proudly. he is sitting with frodo on a terrace overlooking a waterfall. frodo looks at page after page of beautiful handwriting, with intricate maps and drawings. frodo turns a page there before him, is a map of the shire. sam busily tries to stuff more and more things into his already full pack pots and pans, blankets, cooking utensils, provisions, clothes. sam looks up, startled. gandalf and elrond watch frodo and sam from elrond\\'s balcony, elrond turns and walks away. gandalf turns and looks out the window. sounds of arrivals gandalf watches as boromir rides through rivendell gate, followed by legolas and gimli. with the broken sword, isildur slices off sauron\\'s finger. elrond reacts. isildur picks up the ring and stares at it, entranced. elrond and isildur stand before the fires of mt. doom. isildur captivated by the ring. isildur turns and walks away elrond turns to gandalf. strider watches from the shadows as boromir strolls through the darkened gallery. boromir\\'s eyes are drawn to an old fresco on the wall depicting isildur defeating sauron. boromir looks with wonderment at narsil, the broken blade of elendil, which lies on a cloth-covered plinth. boromir senses strider\\'s presence he looks from the blade to strider, as if sensing a connection. strider picks up the broken hilt, as arwen appears behind him. night falls upon the beautiful valley of rivendell still and quiet. strider and arwen stand upon a stone bridge the evenstar at arwen\\'s breast shines in the moonlight. arwen reaches up and gently touches the grey at strider\\'s temples. arwen looks into strider\\'s eyes. arwen closes strider\\'s fingers around the jewel. arwen leans towards strider, gently kissing him. elrond addresses the council. frodo sits amongst a council of free-peoples of middle earth, elrond stands before them, addressing gandalf, strider, legolas, and 20 other elves, dwarves, and men. frodo steps forward and moves towards a stone plinth. he places the ring on the plinth and returns to his seat. strider says nothing and boromir turns away dismissively. legolas stands. frodo looks at strider questioningly boromir turns sharply. gimli suddenly rushes forward. he swings his axe down on the ring. the axe shatters with a deafening crack. gimli falls backwards, staring in disbelief at the ring unharmed. frodo winces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him. he slumps in this chair, clutching his forehead. gandalf looks at him with concern. stunned silence the council sits with downcast eyes, as if a great dread has descended on them. boromir addresses the council in a quiet voice gimli leaps to his feet. motion the angry faces, the shaking fists, the accusatory fingers, his eyes move across to the ring the hum grows louder in his head. the ring fills the screen streams of blood flow across the surface flames flicker within the gold band. frodo breathing rapidly, caught in the grip of his hideous vision. with a huge effort or will, frodo tears his gaze upon the ring. frodo suddenly stands he speaks in a strong, clear voice. sudden silence frodo looks around the room at the astounded faces. boromir looks at them all then walks towards frodo. boromir looks towards elrond and gandalf. frodo stares in wonder as the greatest fighters in all middle earth stand at his side. a sudden noise sam pops up from behind a bush. merry and pippin jump up from behind another bush. elrond surveys the group an old sword sliding out of a shabby leather scabbard its polished, well tendered blade glitters cold and bright. bilbo offers sting to frodo. bilbo unwraps a small shirt of close woven mail. frodo peels off his shirt revealing the ring on the chain around his neck. bilbo sobs and frodo moves to comfort him. the fellowship climb the long steep path out of the cloven vale of rivendell. the fellowship trekking through a land of deep valleys and turbulent waters the misty mountains rise sharply to their left. sam at the campfire. the sound of clashing swords. aragorn and boromir are giving pippin sword tuition. gimli has managed to corner gandalf. boromir thrusts, catching pippin on the hand. pippin throws down his sword, kicks and lunges at boromir, tackling him to the ground. much laughter. legolas\\' eyes are fixed on a distant dark patch which darts about the sky, like flying smoke in the wind. there is as a regiment of large crows fly low overhead at great speed, wheeling and circling above. as their dark shadow passes over the fellowship, a single harsh croak is heard and the crows suddenly wheel away, back towards the south. gandalf staggers to his feet. gandalf looks at aragorn, turns to the others gesturing towards a high mountain pass. the fellowship clamber through rock and snow. frodo slips on some shale as he scrambles to his feet, the ring falls on the ground the ring gleaming in the snow. boromir\\'s hand picks it up by the chain he stands, the ring dangling before his eyes. he seems to grow in stature, as if absorbing its power. aragorn warily approaches boromir boromir is motionless he stares at the ring, as if transfixed. boromir smiles at frodo, ruffling his hair. aragon unhands his sword. following the crows as they race deeper and deeper, passing a vista of industry, hundreds of orcs and writhing birthsacks flying past saruman, who stands upon a wooden gantry. saruman, listening to the cries of the crows. the fellowship are struggling through a blinding blizzard, up towards the pass of caradhras. legolas the elf moves lightly across the top of the snow he suddenly pauses. saruman\\'s voice sweeps by in the wind. thunder rumbles rock and shale fall from above. gandalf raises his staff he chants into the wind. camera sweeps past saruman he stands on the summit of orthanc, chanting. clouds are flowing from all directions converging on the distant mountains in a stormy malestrom. saruman\\'s voice strengthens rolling past the fellowship like thunder. a lightning crack explodes on the mountainside above them. frodo looks up in horror as a huge snow avalanche thunders down towards them. the fellowship throw themselves against the cliff face as snow crashes onto the narrow ledge. legolas pulls gandalf to safety. aragorn shields frodo and sam as snow piles around them. within moments, the pass is blocked and the fellowship are enveloped in snow. boromir and aragorn frantically dig for the hobbits who are pulled out shivering and fearful. frodo, the weight of the decision weighing heavily upon him. merry and pippin shivering in boromir\\'s arms. frodo meets gandalf\\'s eye. the fellowship are walking along the far shore of dark lake directly below great looming cliffs. footing is treacherous on the narrow strip of green and greasy stones. gandalf touches the smooth rock wall between the trees slowly, faint lines appear like slender veins of luminous silver running through the stone. a large moon rises over the mountains the lines grow broader and clearer, forming a glowing arch of interlacing ancient letters and symbols. gandalf raises his arms. the cliff towers into the night, the wind blows cold, frodo shivers and the door stands fast. gandalf continues. mumbling spells in his efforts to open the door. sam packs pots and pans at his feet watching sadly as aragorn un- saddles bill the pony. aragorn whispering to bill the pony. splash. merry and pippin are tossing stones into the lake. black rippling rings slowly fan out. pippin is about to throw another stone, but aragorn grabs his arm. aragorn watches anxiously as the ripples appear to grow he exchanges a look with boromir. aragorn\\'s hand creeps towards his sword. gandalf gives up in despair he sits down beside frodo. frodo peers at the elvish inscription his face breaks into a smile of comprehension. gandalf raises his eyebrows. with that, the rock face silently divides in the middle and two great doors swing outwards revealing a blackness deeper than the night. as the fellowship enter the blackness, something in the water stirs. the fellowship step warily into the darkness of moria a dank cavern, with winding steps leading deeper into the mountain. a glow from gandalf\\'s staff suddenly lights the chamber the fellowship recoil in horror. many dwarf skeletons are strewn about, clearly the dead of some old battle the rusting armor and shields are peppered with arrows and axes. the fellowship draw swords and back away, towards the entrance. frodo is suddenly pulled to the ground. a long sinuous tentacle is wrapped around frodo\\'s ankle and is dragging him towards the lake. frodo cries out as aragorn and boromir rush forward. aragorn severs the tentacle holding frodo, and pulls him to safety boromir hacks at the other writhing limbs. 20 more tentacles ripple out of the lake. the dark water boils as the hideous beast lashes out at the fellowship. again the creature grabs frodo and pulls him to the lake, frodo is flung in the air as the fellowship battle the creature. aragorn hacks at a tentacle frodo is released, falling into boromir\\'s arms. legolas shoots an arrow into the creature\\'s head, gaining a few vital seconds for aragorn and boromir as they race out of the water with frodo. the fellowship hurriedly back away from the creature retreating into the moria chamber as many coiling arms seize the large doors. with a shattering echo, the creature rips the doors away, creating a rock slide that crashes down the cliff face. within seconds, tons of rock seal the doorway throwing the fellowship into pitch blackness. the fellowship crossing a precarious bridge above deep mine workings. they continue up a steep stair, passing through a dwarf cemetery. the graves are despoiled dwarf skeletons are strewn about and goblin graffiti is scrawled on monuments in dried dwarf blood. the atmosphere is very sinister. the path splits into three passages each disappearing into dark tunnels. gandalf pauses, frowning. later the fellowship are nervously waiting while gandalf sits, staring intently at the 3 tunnel mouths in front of him. he appears to be in some kind of trance. frodo he turns at the sound of a faint noise down the tunnel behind them. a sudden glimpse of a creature darting in the darkness. frodo is nervous he approaches gandalf. teasing shot and emaciated, leering creature. gollum\\'s withered fingers are gripping the cave wall he is large, luminous eyes blinking with malice. the fellowship pass under an arched doorway into a black and empty space. gandalf pauses. blazes like a silent flash of lightning. great shadows spring up and flee. their heads, upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone. before them stretches a huge empty hall, with black walls, polished and smooth as glass. ahead of them, a wooden door has been smashed. black arrows are embedded in the timbers. two goblin skeletons lie in the doorway. gimli rushes ahead. gimli rushes into another vast empty chamber lit with a narrow shaft of sunlight, beaming in from a small hole near the roof. dwarf and goblin skeletons are piled high. in the far corner sits a stone walled well. a shaft of light falls directly onto a stone table in the middle of the room a single oblong block, about 4 feet high, topped with a great slab of white stone. gimli falls to his knees. gimli sobs. gandalf quietly reads an inscription of runes, carved onto the white stone slab. gandalf carefully lifts the rotting remains of a book from the white stone slab. it has been slashed and stabbed and appears to be covered in dried blood. the pages crack and break as he opens it. unnerved, pippin backs away nervously he stumbles against the well, sending a precariously balanced armored skeleton tumbling in. merry reaches out, grabbing hold of pippin before he falls. the fellowship freeze in stunned silence as the armored skeleton clatters down the deep well echoing loudly. gandalf turns angrily on pippin. pippin, chastened. they fall silent. a low rolling boom rises from the depths below growing louder boom boom as if the caverns of moria were turned into a vast drum. a great horn blasts nearby answering horns running feet harsh cries sam\\'s eyes glance at frodo\\'s belt. aragorn and boromir slam and wedge the doors. boromir catches sight of something he turns to aragorn with shock in his eyes. gimli snatches up two rusty dwarf axes and leaps onto the tomb. boom. the door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments, and 20 goblins charge into the tomb, followed by a huge cave troll. gimli ducks a blow and immediately buries his axes in 2 goblin helmets. aragorn and boromir wade into the mass of goblins with their swords. legolas fires deadly arrows into goblin throats, desperately trying to shield the hobbits. gandalf is clutching his sword and joins in the battle. the cave troll is sweeping his club at aragorn who stumbles backwards the huge club descends for the killing blow suddenly, in a flash of steel, boromir\\'s long sword slices into the scaly arm of the troll it rears back, spewing green blood. sam is backing up against a wall a sword in one hand, a saucepan in the other. in desperation he swings wildly at a goblin with a saucepan. it keels over sam looks surprised. he wallops another goblin and it too, drops. the cave troll lunges forward, thrusting at frodo\\'s chest with his spear. the hobbits go crazy. sam slashes at the cave troll\\'s knee, bringing him down merry and pippin jump on him legolas fires an arrow and the cave troll topples, dead. aragorn rushes to frodo\\'s side as he slumps to the floor frodo appears to be dead. gandalf, aragorn, hobbits looking horrified suddenly frodo coughs takes a huge breath. frodo open his shirt to reveal the mithril vest. the troll spear did not pierce the mithril.\" boom. boom. boom the sound of the drums rings out again. gandalf turns to the others. gandalf leads the fellowship into the huge dwarrowdelf chamber. a huge shadow, surrounded by flame, falls across the hall the ground shakes an unearthly sound rumbles. the balrog, a massive creature rises from a chasm, a great 40 foot man-beast, with a mane of flames. in one hand is a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire in the other, a whip of many thongs. aragorn leads the fellowship to the top of a dizzying stairway gandalf follows, leaning heavily on his staff. aragorn looks at gandalf, concerned. aragorn hesitates gandalf looks at him. the fellowship race down the stairway, aragorn picks up frodo leaping across a gaping chasm. a narrow bridge, spanning a bottomless pit gandalf yells to the others aragorn makes to throw gimli across the chasm. the fellowship run into a hall the floor is split with fissures that spit flame. they race towards the slender bridge of stone without kerb or rail at the far end of the hall. the fellowship recklessly hurry over the dizzying bridge but gandalf the last pauses in the middle of the span he faces the balrog staff in one hand sword in the other. frodo looks back in horror frodo watches as the balrog puts one foot on the bridge and draws up to full height, wings spreading from wall-to-wall. gandalf is a tiny figure, balanced precariously on the narrow bridge. flame gandalf blocks with his sword a ringing clash and the balrog\\'s sword shatters into molten fragments. gandalf cries aloud as he summons up his last reserves of strength. he thumps the bridge with his staff a blinding sheet of white flame springs up the staff shatters the bridge breaks right at balrog\\'s feet. the stone bridge drops away into the gulf from under the balrog. for a moment, the great beast remains poised in the air then it plunges down in slow motion relief floods frodo\\'s face gandalf remains trembling on the lip of the broken bridge. as the balrog falls, he lashes out with his whip of fire the thongs of the whip lash and curl around gandalf\\'s knees, dragging him over the brink. gandalf just manages to hand on by his fingertips gandalf lets go his grip and falls away following the balrog into the bottomless abyss. frodo cries out. boromir scoops him up and carries him away. they rush towards an archway. the fellowship tumble out of the great eastern gate on to a grassy sunlit hillside. sam, merry, and pippin fall slowly to the ground, sobbing aragorn turns to legolas and gimli. frodo slowly turns a look of numb shock on his devastated face. the fellowship marches on. aragorn scours ahead of the company, as they stumble on in the fading light in the distance the shimmer of a large forest can be seen lothlorien. the fellowship run across a forest floor strewn with yellow flowers above is a roof of golden leaves, held up by silver pillars the trunks of huge, grey trees. gimli looks nervously around. frodo hesitates a strange voice whispers in his head. haldir\\'s eyes lock onto frodo. haldir leads the fellowship onto a hill top. they look with wonderment at the vista spread before them. several miles towards the south, a large hill rises out of the woods. upon the hill rise many mighty mallorn trees, taller than any others nestled high in the crown of the mallorns is a beautiful city. it gleams in the low rays of the late afternoon sun green, gold, and silver. to the east of caras galadhon, the woods of lorien run down the pale gleam of anduin, the great river. beyond the river, the land appears flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away, it rises again like a dark and dreary wall. the sun that lies on lothlorien has not power to enlighten the shadows that lie beyond. the fellowship step onto a wide fleet filled with a soft light. the walls are green and silver, the roof gold and in its midst is the trunk of the might mallorn tree, now tapering toward its crown. celeborn steps forward to greet the guests. his hair is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no sign of age upon it. next to him stands galadriel, the lady of the elves. she has hair of deep gold and timeless, unsurpassed beauty. celeborn looks hard at aragorn. frodo looks at galadriel, standing silently beside celeborn. galadriel\\'s eyes settle on sam. side powerful, divine no longer of this world a piercing white light surrounds her. gimli, legolas, merry, pippin, frodo and sam are in a pavilion set among the trees near the fountain. they lie on soft couches as elves leave food and wine for them. mournful singing drifts down from the trees above. moonlight catches the trace of tears on boromir\\'s face. aragorn kneels down beside him. boromir looks at aragorn in despair. aragorn returns boromir\\'s smile betraying his disquiet sadness only when boromir looks away. later. the fellowship are asleep on their beds. gimli is snoring loudly. bare feet tread soundlessly across the lawn. frodo\\'s eyes flicker open as if by instinct. galadriel, her white dress glowing in the moonlight, glances at him. frodo follows her as if drawn by an invisible force. upon a low stone pedestal, carved like a branching tree, sits a shallow silver basin. galadriel leads frodo into the small glade. galadriel pours water into the basin from a silver jug a glow rises from the water. frodo slowly steps up to the pedestal he peers into the glossy surface. the night sky is reflected into the water suddenly a figure takes form the bowed figure of an old man, clad in white robes. he walks down a long road. frodo leans closer to the mirror\\'s surface. gandalf lifts his head and looks directly at frodo. frodo gasps, his face lighting up with hope. gandalf looks at frodo with a fierce intensity. frodo reaches out his hand toward the surface of the mirror. suddenly the image flares, burning out to white. the vision shifts frodo gasps in horror. the shire is in ruins. the image suddenly widens to fill the screen buildings burning bodies strewn about dark shapes of orcs looting and destroying bag end, billowing in flames. the party tree is hacked down. frodo reels back as the mirror seems to grow the nightmarish image sweeps past his head, engulfing him entirely. hobbiton now an industrial wasteland. the fields and trees destroyed replaced with brick factories belching smoke. orcs brutally herd manacled hobbits into the factories. we see sam merry and rosie cotton. soot- stained and sobbing, they disappear into the factory hell- hole. suddenly, the mirror goes dark and out of the black abyss a single eye grows. frodo is frozen. unable to move or cry out. the ring dangles from his neck, inches above the water not shimmering with curls of steam. fire erupts around the eye with a yell, frodo pushes himself away from the pedestal and collapses on the ground. light instantly fades from the mirror. frodo comes to his senses he is shocked. galadriel stands still as a statue, unmoved, untouched by the horror. galadriel looks at frodo intensely frodo looks down in his hand he is clutching the ring. frodo looks up at galadriel. galadriel suddenly seems to rise in stature before frodo\\'s eyes. frodo is suddenly afraid of her. galadriel suddenly laughs a slender elf-woman once more, clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad. frodo realizes what her message is. the ring lies in the palm of frodo\\'s hand his fingers close over it. naked, lurtz\\'s eyes follow saruman, alight with a mean intelligence. lurtz is quickly armored breastplate leg guards, helmet a sword is thrust in lurtz\\'s hand. the uruk- hai are smearing themselves in white paint a creepy ritualistic ceremony the white hand of isengard is smeared on bodies, faces, and armor. saruman address a crowd of 200 fully armed uruk-hai. lurtz is leading 200 uruk-hai out of isengard they run fast, their powerful legs carrying them at speed. the fellowship are in small elven boats. they row away from the lothlorien shore into the silverlode river. elves quietly watch them depart. galadriel gives frodo a small crystal phial. the boats pass into the great river anduin. the three elven boats carry the fellowship steadily southward. green trees slowly give way to a brown and withered land. the uruk forces are running through the trees with deadly purpose. a flock of birds circle high above, black against the pale sky. aragorn watches them with concern. the three elven boats drift slowly through the steep rocky gorge in the pre-dawn light. aragorn, slowly paddling in the stern. frodo slowly looks up, his eyes widening with amazement. two enormous rock statues, towering like 300 foot pinnacles on either side of the river carved images of gondorian kings of old. they loom over the boats with power and majesty. aragorn strangely moved by the beauty of the silent sentinels. he speaks, almost as if to himself. the fellowship stare in stunned silence as the current takes them through the narrow gap between the statues\\' feet. the fellowship as they leap out of the boats and clamber onto the wooded shore. legolas turns to aragorn with urgency. legolas casts a glance around into the parth galen forest. sam sits up with a start aragorn\\'s head snaps round his eyes fly to boromir\\'s shield which lies abandoned by his camp bed. aragorn as he realizes boromir has gone. frodo is walking beneath the trees lost in thought. his feet hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab his eyes follow an overgrown path towards stone stairs leading to the summit of amon hen the seeing seat. a crackling sound. frodo freezes. frodo turns slowly he stares at boromir, tense, cautious. frodo stands silent for a moment the murmur of the wind in the trees and the distant roar of the falls of rauros can be heard boromir has started forward towards frodo, he pulls himself up. frodo steps hurriedly away from boromir. frodo turns to leave. boromir leaps on top of frodo, grasping for the ring. frodo has only moments to act. frodo rips the ring from around his neck and rams it on his finger. frodo races through the misty twilight world, past the foggy shapes of twisted trees. somewhere behind him, boromir\\'s distraught voice carries from another dimension frodo suddenly finds himself on the stone steps he clambers up the stairs, onto a high seat, perched on four stone pillars. frodo cowers on the seat, like a lost child upon the throne of mountain kings. the world of mist swirls around him. frodo peers out from the seat the world seems to shrink. in all directions, views of far off lands telescope towards him through the mist. orcs spilling out of holes in the misty mountains flames rising from mirkwood grim faced easterlings march to war black ships sailing into the south. all the power of the dark lord is in motion. frodo moves his gaze towards the east fire explodes against the smoke, as a huge mass of black battlements fills frodo\\'s vision. a mountain of iron, immeasurably strong, tower of adamant barad-dur, fortress of sauron. suddenly. sauron\\'s eye leaps toward frodo like a finger of light. they will fall. frodo leaps off the seat, and tumbles down the stairs. the eye sweeps amon hen like a searchlight, seeking its ring. with a huge effort, frodo wrenches the ring off his finger. frodo lies gasping on the summit of amon hen below the ancient ruins of the seeing seat. at that moment a black boot steps into shot. frodo looks up as aragorn towers over him. frodo backs away from aragorn aragorn is shocked by the movement. frodo uncurls his fist in is palm lies the ring. it glints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun aragorn\\'s eyes are drawn to it. aragorn freezes. he draws his sword. frodo hesitates. frodo backs away into the trees as 200 uruk-hai swarm onto amon hen behind aragorn. aragorn attacks the leading uruk-hai like a madman he brings two down with his sword leaping into the ruins as others close in on him. frodo scrambles down the hillside, away from the fight. aragorn battles the uruk-hai, amongst the pillars and blocks of amon hen. despite his bravery, he is quickly surrounded suddenly elven arrows smash into the uruk-hai. legolas races out of the woods, firing his bow. gimli leaps into the battle, wielding his might axe. frodo is darting down the steep hillside as heave feet thunder down behind him. sam looks around for frodo. lurtz ordering his uruks. frodo stumbles and falls quickly he crawls behind a tree above him the sound of uruk-hai crashing through the forest rings out. frodo turns to see merry and pippin hidden in a hollow, a few feet away. frodo looks at his friends slowly shakes his head, a great sadness in his eyes. pippin stands and makes a move toward frodo merry grabs at his arm. the echo of boromir\\'s horn reaches aragorn, legolas, and gimli they are battling their way down the slopes towards the lake. aragorn desperately slashes his way towards boromir, felling uruk-hai in his path while legolas and gimli fight a rear guard action. many uruk-hai fall to boromir\\'s sword as he tries to protect merry and pippin. lurtz takes aim. a black arrow suddenly thuds into boromir\\'s chest. amazingly, boromir continues fighting, but another arrow and another, brings him to his knees. merry and pippin are scooped off their feet by uruk-hai. lurtz aims his bow at boromir\\'s heart suddenly aragorn charges at him, smashing the bow with his sword. they lock into a deadly battle. aragorn cuts lurtz down and races towards boromir, who lies slumped against a tree uruk-hai arrows sticking out of his chest. at least 20 dead uruk-hai lie heaped around boromir. his horn lies at his feet cloven in two. boromir holds aragorn\\'s gaze. aragorn places boromir\\'s sword in his hand. boromir\\'s fingers tighten around the hilt. on the lakeshore frodo stands in front of one of the elvish boats, the ring in his palm. a distraught sam running as hard as he can through the forest. frodo looks to the far side of the river the camera moves in on the ring. tears fall down frodo\\'s face. with renewed determination, frodo tucks the ring inside his vest pocket. the small figure of frodo pushing the elvish boat into the water sam bursts through the trees and runs toward the lake frodo is already paddling away. shore tears in his eyes the voice of sam carried on the wind. frodo whispers to himself sam looks at the water then at the boat. splash. frodo turns to see sam launching himself into the water. sam splashes hopelessly toward the boat. sam starts to go under, spluttering and coughing frodo drops his paddle and scrambles backwards in the boat. sam is underwater hands flailing helplessly as he sinks. frodo\\'s hand grasping sam\\'s frodo pulls a bedraggled and half drowned sam into the boat. frodo and sam look at each other, out of breath, tears and water streaming down both their faces. frodo starts to laugh through his tears the two friends hug. the two hobbits row through the water. looking down on swiftly flowing water boromir\\'s body slides under camera. he is lying in one of the boats, his arms across his chest his broken horn at his side. suddenly the boat drops away from camera as it plunges over the massive falls of rauros, disappearing into the vapor below. aragorn looks towards the far shore frodo and sam\\'s small boat can be seen lying on the distant riverbank as frodo and sam make off into the forest beyond. he doesn\\'t react. legolas turns and looks at aragorn. aragorn pulls a hunting knife out of his pack and straps it on. aragorn, legolas, and gimli disappear into the woods, following the uruk-hai trail. frodo and sam scramble onto a high ridge. a distant line of saw toothed mountains below a dark, oppressive sky. black volcanic smoke rises behind the mountains mordor. frodo looks at sam with great affection despite the grim outlook, sam is undeterred. the two hobbits setting off toward mordor. the end camera zooms in through the mountain and focuses on gandalf and the balrog on the bridge of khazad-dum. the balrog strikes down on gandalf with its flaming sword. gandalf parries the blow with glamdring, shattering the balrog\\'s sword. gandalf strikes his staff onto the bridge. as the balrog steps forward, the bridge collapses from under it and the demon plunges backward into the chasm. gandalf, exhausted, leans on his staff and watches the balrog fall then turns to follow the others. at the last minute, the flaming whip lashes up from the depths of the abyss and winds around gandalf\\'s ankle, dragging him over the edge. he clings onto the bridge but is straining to keep his grip. frodo rushes forward but boromir restrains him. gandalf loses his grip and falls into the chasm gandalf loses his grip and falls into the chasm calls after gandalf as he falls into the abyss gandalf falls after the balrog and grabs hold of his sword glamdring on his way down. as they continue to plunge into the depths, gandalf hacks away at the balrog even as it thrashes and bounces off the walls. they continue to plunge at great speed, sometimes with gandalf clinging to the horn of the demon. the battling pair then falls into an enormous cavern and plunges into the water. just then frodo awakens as if from a nightmare. lies back down. frodo and sam climbs over the rocky terrain emyn muil. they look into the distance at the mountain of fire. suddenly frodo feels and sees the eye zooming in on him. he gasps and pants as he backs away. clutches the ring by his chest and sits down, still panting. he then fumbles for his water bottle and takes a sip. he takes out a package of lembas bread from his packhe digs deeper into his pack sam shows another package. he then breaks off a piece and tosses it to frodo, and munches on a piece himself. smiles sam smiles back, and then looks ominously towards mordor. they continue trekking through difficult terrain, often huddling underneath their cloaks. looks around exasperated drops to a whisper nighttime frodo and sam are sleeping. a dark shape appears on top of the cliff. the creature gollum has appeared and is making his way down to the hobbits. gollum creeps closer and closer. gollum reaches out his hand towards the hobbits. suddenly the hobbits spring up, grab hold of gollum\\'s arms and pull him down. amidst the struggle, gollum wriggles loose and leaps onto frodo. as frodo falls back, the chain and ring around his neck is revealed and gollum jumps straight for the ring. sam tries to grab at him but is knocked away. gollum now jumps on top of frodo and tries to reach for the ring even as frodo grabs his hands and tries to push him away. gollum\\'s cheeks puff with exertion as he struggles with frodo, his enormous eyes fixed on the ring. sam grabs hold of gollum again and tears him away from frodo. gollum then turns around and bites sam on the shoulder, wriggles around and clasps his arms around sam\\'s neck and legs around his waist in a death grip. frodo unsheathes sting and holds it to gollum\\'s throat. menacingly slowly, gollum loosens his grip on sam and as the latter disentangles himself, gollum wails. in the next scene, gollum is being dragged with sam\\'s elvish rope around his neck, wailing and writhing in pain. sam tugs fiercely at the rope. gollum cries some

frodo looks down and sees gollum diving into the water. he gestures to archers hidden in the bushes. the rangers notch their arrows frodo looks stricken. gollum emerges from the pool onto a rock. he holds a fish in his hand and starts singing, slapping the fish on the rock as he goes. singingwhacks the fish on the rockwhacksthe fish almost wriggles out of his grasp and he whacks it some more. faramir has his hand raised to order his men to shoot. at the last moment, frodo calls out. faramir stops faramir nods. frodo descends to the forbidden pool and approaches gollum who is gorging on the raw fish. gollum turns round at frodo\\'s voice. frodo gestures for gollum to follow him. with the fish between his teeth, gollum follows frodo warily. suddenly he looks up in alarm and is caught by rangers. wails a black cloth is brought over gollum\\'s head. frodo stares after them with a stricken expression as faramir leads gollum and his men away. back in the cave, gollum is thrown down to the ground. crying, he crawls into a corner and curls up into ball. cooing, his hand stroking his shoulder sobbing sobbing hits his fist against the wall whimpers turns to faramir with a ferocious expressionhe bares his teeth and growls back in their holding area, sam and frodo are alone. they both stand as faramir enters. unsheathes his sword faramir lifts the ring from frodo\\'s neck with the tip of his sword. frodo is backed up fearfully against the wall. the ring whispers and frodo falls into a trance. suddenly, he grabs the ring in his hand and jerks himself away. he runs away from faramir faramir stares at frodo. just then damrod enters. he turns to leave. sam looks after faramir sadly. aragorn is riding towards helm\\'s deep. on the way, he sees an enormous uruk-hai army marching with great speed. he quickly makes haste towards helm\\'s deep and soon sees the refuge. patting brego on the neck he rides into helm\\'s deep to the amazement of all. pushing his way through the crowd.he sees aragorn.he hugs aragorn. gimli gestures to the hall. as aragorn makes his way in, he runs into legolas who stands waiting. they smile. legolas pauses and looks at aragorn\\'s wounds. to the side, eowyn sees aragorn and smiles joyously and with relief. legolas takes aragorn\\'s hand and gives the evenstar pendant. aragorn looks at the evenstar and claps legolas on the shoulder. eowyn looks on and smiles even as tears fill her eyes. aragorn is in the keep, conferring with theoden walks away resolutely along the passage behind the deeping wall. to gamling gamling nods and goes off. theoden stands at the gate of helm\\'s deep, speaking to aragorn, legolas and gimli. gimli seems miffed. legolas claps a hand on gimli\\'s shoulder as he follows aragorn and theoden back in. draws close to aragorn he walks away, calling out orders cutting him off to the soldiers men rush to prepare for battle as flocks of carrion crows circle overhead. treebeard walks through the forest carrying merry and pippin. he comes to a clearing and stops. merry and pippin turns round as they hear movement from the forest around them. they see many more ents like treebeard gathering. merry licks his lips in anticipation. back at helm\\'s deep, the women and children are being led into the caves. old men and young lads are being drafted for war. the women and children say their tearful and reluctant farewells as their fathers, husbands and sons are led away by soldiers. in the armoury, weapons are being distributed. aragorn picks up a battered sword, looks at it and tosses it back. the men around them fell silent. legolas speaks to aragorn. he pauses and then walks away. legolas makes as if to go after him. puts a hand on legolas in the hall puts armour onto theoden the villagers are handed their weapons. an oversized helmet is placed on a wide-eyed boy. another stares at the axe that he is handed with frightened eyes. another child wearing oversized chain mail takes up a huge shield. theoden stands inside the main hall of the keep, his back to the entrance where a bright white light is streaming through. everyone is getting ready for war at the battlements. aragorn is sitting on the steps. he sees a young lad in armour holding a sword looking around nervously. aragorn gives the battered sword a few swings. he hands the sword back to haleth and leans close to him, putting a hand on his shoulder. back at the armoury, aragorn dons his battle gear. his sword is handed to him as he reaches for it. he nods and accepts the sword from legolas. they smile and clap one another on the shoulders. they look at gimli as he walks up to them, struggling with his chain mail. he drops the bundle and the chain mail lands with its length right to the floor. aragorn and legolas bite back smiles. just then, a horn sounds in the background they run out to the battlements. the guards look down in wonderment. to another guard an army of lothlorien elves march up the causeway into the hornburg. they are led by haldir. the rohirrim soldiers look upon them in wonderment and delight as they pass. he looks up to see aragorn, legolas and gimli running down the steps, and smiles he bowshe grabs haldir in a huge embrace. initially stunned, haldir hugs him back lightly. legolas and haldir clasp each other on the shoulder. turning to theoden men and elves are in their positions on the battlements of helm\\'s deep. the sounds of a marching army move closer and closer. the women and children in the caves hear the sounds overhead and are frightened. mothers draw their children close and try to sooth crying babies. the men and elves look out into the darkness, lit by the thousands of torches carried by the huge advancing uruk-hai army and the light bouncing off their armour. with a row of elf archers, gimli is standing beside legolas behind a wall, only the top of his helmet visible. grumbling and straining to look above the wall. legolas smirks. aragorn approaches and stands beside them thunder sounds and lightning flashes, revealing the sea of approaching uruk-hai. the marching and thumping grows louder and louder. lightning flashes and it begins to rain. while the uruk-hai army continues to march at the fortress, an uruk-hai leader steps on a rock outcrop. aragorn is giving commands to the elf warriors. the uruk-hai leader raises his swords and commands his army to stop with a terrifying animalic cry. the uruks stop and growl in anticipation of the upcoming battle and slaughter jumping and straining to see looks at gimli with a grin laughs good-naturedly the uruk leader cries out once, encouraging the uruk-hai to start roaring and thumping their spears furiously.the women and children in the caves huddle together in fear. suddenly, aldor, the old man next to haleth, loses his grip and releases his arrow prematurely, shooting an uruk-hai in the neck. the uruk-hai army stop their roaring and thumping. with a hollow groan, the uruk that was shot collapsed to the ground. the other uruk-hai bare their teeth and roar with anger. with a cry, the uruk-hai leader thrusts his weapon in the air and the uruk-hai army starts charging. the elves notch their arrow and aim. arrows rain down on the uruk-hai below, killing many. to the men more arrows are released. but the uruk-hai army keep advancing, with more replacing those fallen. impatiently the uruk-hai start to load ladders onto the walls, pushing them up with their long spears. the elves draw their blades in preparation for combat. the first ladders are almost reaching the walls with big nasty uruk berserkers on top of them. close combat begins as the uruk-hai climb over the wall. holding up two fingers outragedhe turns to a uruk just climbing over the wall, whacking it in the groin with his axe and killing it as it falls. fires two arrows the ent moot is still in progress. the ents sway a little as they continue to deliberate. merry and pippin are sitting a distance away. suddenly, treebeard nods and turns to the hobbits. gesturing long pause with his eyes closed. angles his head in query impatiently waving a hand merry and pippin roll their eyes in disgruntlement. gimli is standing on the wall between two ladders, hacking away at uruk-hai as they come up camera pans over the uruk-hai below and turns to the causeway. a group of uruk-hai is advancing on the causeway towards the gate in tortoise formation, using their broad shields to block off attacks. directs the elf archers to aim at the uruk-hai column. the elf archers release their arrows. the uruk-hai at the sides are shot and fall down the causeway. but the column keeps advancing. at the bottom of the deeping wall, two spiky bombs are lodge in the sluice gate. the rest opens a path and an uruk-hai carrying a torch starts to run towards the sluice gate. aragorn spots the uruk-hai. legolas shoots the uruk-hai in the shoulder but the latter keeps going legolas shoots the uruk again. it stumbles and then throws it self and the torch at the bombs. an enormous explosion is set off, blowing away a large part of the wall. rock, debris and bodies are thrown up. aragorn is also thrown back by the force of the explosion and on the ground, knocked out. theoden looks on in shock as the uruk-hai streams in past the deeping walls. gimli sees the uruk-hai charging in with aragorn in their path. with a cry, he jumps down from the wall and lands on the uruk-hai army, taking them out as he stands. he is soon overpowered. aragorn gets up and sees gimli falling. he yells to the elves behind him the arrows take out the first group of uruk-hai coming through the hole in the wall. aragorn leads the elves in a charge towards the uruk-hai streaming in. he rushes to gimli\\'s side and picks him up. at the top of the battlements, legolas grabs a shield and sends it sliding across the ground. he then hops onto it and surfs down the steps, releasing three arrows as he goes, and kicking the shield to stab an uruk-hai as he lands at the bottom. at the ent moot the ents look at one another, taken back merry is putting on his jacket. pippin approaches him slowly looking into the distance.turns to pippin and puts a hand on his shoulder pippin looks after merry as he walks away. haldir nods and turns back. gimli is being carried away, kicking and struggling as he goes protesting haldir hacks at a few uruk as he turns towards the gate. suddenly, he is stabbed in his arm. and looks down as his wound in seeming disbelief. an uruk-hai comes up from behind him unnoticed and slices him on the neck. as haldir goes down, he looks around him and sees his kin fallen among dead uruk-hai. sees haldir fallinghe runs up the steps to haldir\\'s side and catches him and he collapses. haldir\\'s head rolls back, his eyes empty and unseeing. aragorn bows his head in grief. then with a cry, he jumps onto a ladder and swings down to the ground, killing as he goes. drawing his sword theoden and his commanders come to the gate, which is under heavy attack. the uruk-hai are knocking down the gate and hacking through the broken wood. theoden stabs at an uruk-hai and receives a lance in his shoulder, blocked by his armour. grimacing in pain, theoden continues to stab at the uruk until led away by gamling. runs up and stabs away at the uruk-hai through the broken gate aragorn and gimli slip out a side exit and stand on a ledge just to the side of the main gate. aragorn peeks over, seeing the large band of uruk-hai storming the gate. gimli takes a peek and then steps back. mumbles aragorn nods slowly and then turns to grab the dwarf. gimli stays aragorn\\'s hand he tosses gimli to the head of the causeway and then leaps over. making quick work of killing the uruk-hai on the other side of the gate men are bracing the gate with wood and nails. aragorn and gimli continue to fight off the uruk-hai just outside. meanwhile the uruk-hai load and fires enormous hooks over the battlements. hundred of uruk-hai climb onto super-ladders as they are pulled up towards the walls, the super-ladders locking onto the edge of the battlements with their steel grips. legolas takes aim as another super-ladder is being pulled up and shoots away one of the ropes. the ladder falls back onto the uruk-hai army. through a crack in the gate legolas calls to them from the top of the battlements he throws them a rope aragorn grabs gimli in one hand and the rope with the other as they are pulled up the wall. just then the uruk-hai load and fires enormous hooks over the battlements. hundred of uruk-hai climb onto super-ladders as they are pulled up towards the walls, the super-ladders locking onto the edge of the battlements with their steel grips. legolas takes aim as another super-ladder is being pulled up and shoots away one of the ropes. the ladder falls back onto the uruk-hai army. they all run towards the keep, legolas firing two arrows into the uruk-hai army as he goes. treebeard is walking through the forest, carrying merry and pippin. the hobbits look dejected. pippin suddenly looks up with a gleam in his eyes. treebeard comes to a stop. faramir and company draws close to osgiliath. with tears in his eyes faramir hesitates for a moment. he presses them on frodo and sam are pushed on towards osgiliath treebeard, merry and pippin come to the southern edge of the forest. he sees the desolated landscape of tree stumps that used to be forested grounds with tears in his eyeshis gaze turns to the treeless isengard and its smoking caverns he lets out a ferocious roar that echoes through the forest merry and pippin turn around as they hear rumbles from the forest. they see many ents emerging and marching towards them osgiliath is still under siege as faramir and company arrives, dodging arrows and falling rocks. frodo suddenly seems stricken frodo sees that sam is speaking to him but he hears nothing. his senses are overcome. sam breaks away as they are being led away. a boulder crashes into a tower overhead and shatters it. suddenly, frodo\\'s eyes roll up and he stares at faramir strangely. in a faraway voice looking uphe grabs the hobbits and thrusts them into a corner.to his men banners of the white hand are flying from the battlements of helm\\'s deep. the hornburg is overrun with uruk-hai. theoden and company are in the hall of the keep. carrying a table with legolas to shore up the door of the hall in the glittering caves, the women and children cry in fear as they hear the battering ram banging on the door. there is no answer. pause a light of determination shines in his eyes aragorn looks up at a window to see faint light streaming through. he recalls gandalf\\'s words. gimli runs up the steps to the horn of helm hammerhand he mounts his horse and puts on his helmet. the sound of the horn rumbles through helm\\'s deep as gimli blows with gusto. theoden leads the charge out of the keep into the hornburg, slashing away at the uruk-hai as they go. without pause, they storm out of the gate and down the causeway, right into the column of waiting uruk-hai. in the midst of battle, aragorn looks east and sees a white rider against the rising sun coming up from behindhe raises a hand riders move up behind eomer. looking to the east the rohirrim and the white rider charge down the slope. half the uruk-hai army turns to face the challenge, bearing their spears down towards the riders. as the riders draw closer, the sun rises behind them, momentarily blinding the uruk-hai who raise the hands and spears to shield their eyes. the riders crash right into the uruk-hai and engage them in battle. the ents are stomping over isengard, swinging their huge limbs, throwing and stamping on orcs and rolling huge boulders over the ground. an ent is pulled down with chains by some orcs, who immediately jump on and hacks away at his wooden limbs. saruman rushes out onto the balcony of orthanc and stares at the pandemonium in incredulity. merry and pippin also throws stones at orcs, their aims true. two ents rock a wooden structure and push it over into the caverns below, smashing against the rock. some orcs fire flamed-tipped arrows at an ent, setting him on fire. saruman continues to look about from his balcony, helpless. some ents are now breaking away at a dam. the dam is broken and saruman looks up to see the river rushing down the slope towards isengard, washing away orcs and wooden structures in its path. the hobbits tighten their hold on top of treebeard treebeard braces himself against the flood. as the water rushes over isengard, an ent rushes in and thrusts his burning body into the water. the water rushes into the caverns, washing away the bridges, mechanisms and structures within. frodo walks slowly away from the safe corner. gondorian rangers are still running about, defending their stations. slow motion frodo walks up some stairs and stands on a bridge. a nazgul on a fell beast emerges in front of him. frodo stares at the nazgul, fixated. feeling the call of the ring, he holds it up. faramir watches the unfolding tableau from below. as frodo moves to put the ring on his finger and the nazgul flies closer and closer, sam runs up and knocks frodo over. faramir releases an arrow and shoots the fell beast. frodo and sam roll down the stairs. as they come to a stop at the bottom, frodo holds sam in a death grip, yells and points sting at his throat, his eyes livid with madness and anger that someone would try to take the ring away. with tears running down his face the madness fades and recognition returns to frodo\\'s eyes. he realises what he nearly did and is overcome. stumbling backwards, he collapses against a wall and sting falls to the ground with a clang. sam gets up slowly. slowly and with despair getting up slowlyhe stands and leans against a wall, looking out into the distance.images of the riders winning the battle against the uruk-hai at helm\\'s deep he raises his sword with a victorious cry the women and children welcome the men as they return. eowyn runs up to

corner, even gollum seems moved. faramir walks over and comes to kneel in front of frodo sam shakes the ranger\\'s hand from his shoulder. frodo looks up at faramir with gladness. over in the realm of rohan, gandalf, theoden and company ride to the top of a slope, looking towards the mountain of fire in the distance. frodo and sam are walking through the woods, away from osgiliath. frodo turns to look at sam. smilinghe turns to walk on dreamilyhe gives his backpack a heave and follows frodo gollum is crouching a short distance away twists the branch of a tree scuttles and hides behind a tree

frodo and sam following behind. camera pans up over the forest and ephel d\\'ath to reveal the desolation of mordor. to the left of the frame is the glowing eye of sauron atop barad-dur, and to the right of the frame is the fiery mount doom. three fell beasts circle the dark skies. lightning flashes as the scene fades to black. smeagol and his cousin, deagol, sit in a small coracle, their fishing lines draped over the side sunshine glinting off the surface of the water. an idyllic image. suddenly deagol\\'s fishing rod bends under the weight of a large fish. deagol pulls on his rod, but is hauled overboard and disappears underwater with a splash. smeagol leaning over the boat concerned. deagol is towed to the river bed by a large fish he suddenly lets go of the line eyes fixed on

eyes. the hum of the ring growing louder. deagol turns to look at him, a smirk on his face. smeagol moves towards deagol. smeagol jumps on deagol strangling him. smeagol rips the glittering ring from deagol\\'s limp hand. smeagol slips the ring onto his finger and disappears. smeagol descending into madness. his body twists and distorts he becomes a creepy, shrivelled wretch finally crawling into

the ring as gollum peers at them with gleaming eyes. sam stirs, looks at frodo. frodo shakes his head. the ground suddenly quivers, as a rolling, rumbling noise echoes down the valley. sam shoots gollum a hostile look and turns back to rummage in his knapsack. he holds up a piece of dried lembas bread to frodo. frodo looksa t sam questioningly. frodo says nothing. frodo and sam follow gollum as he leads them on the wining, torturous path clambering through bracken and over jagged rocks. gandalf leads aragorn, legolas, theoden and gimli through dark woodland. the moving forest of fangorn opens before them creating an avenue of trees, which allows them access along the old isengard road. a thick, humid mist fills the forest. the foest separates ahead, revealing the ruins of isengard. all about, the great stone wall is cracked and splintered into countless jagged shards. two small hobbits are sitting on the smashed wall merry and pippin. spread before them is a feast of breads, meats and wine. they puff on long pipes as they lie back in the sun. merry cuts pippin off before he can respond in kind. gandalf, aragorn, legolas and gimli stare at the sight before them. gandalf leads the company through the flotsam and jetsam which floats upon the muddied waters surrounding the tower treebeard, the giant ent, strides towards them, alarming all but gandalf. gandalf stares up the long length of the dark tower. the old ent nods his head wisely. pippin, his eye caught by something lying in the water the muddy waters glowing wit a golden light. aragorn turns as, quick as a flash, pippin has jumped off his ho rse an d pi cke d u p -- th e pa lan tir . pippin doesn\\'t move, his eyes staring in wonder at the smooth black stone. reluctantly, pippin hands the palantir to

uncle moves away. merry and pippin are in full voice, on top of one of the tables both hold very large mugs of ale in their hands. gandalf laughing and clapping the hobbits. aragorn steps up beside him, smiling at the floorshow. gandalf turns quickly to aragorn. gandalf watches his friend\\'s face seeking reassurance. frodo and sam lie asleep amidst scrubby bushes near a stagnant pool. smeagol lies nearby, muttering in his sleep. smeagol wakes suddenly, shaking, his face drenched in sweat, eyes wide in horror. smeagol\\'s features suddenly transform into the malevolent face of gollum. smeagol casts a quick glance over his shoulder to the sleeping figures of frodo and sam as he clambers off his rock silently sidling towards the edge of a stagnant pool. smeagol stares into the murky depths of the water. the surface ripples as the face of gollum appears as smeagol\\'s reflection. smeagol choking deagol fingers locked tight around his throat. sam his eyes flicker open. sudden sam

the golden hall, oblivious to the chill wind they look out across the sleeping city to the looming mountain range beyond -. dark clouds mark the sky. legolas looks at aragorn realisation in his face. pippin he is awake. he sits up anxious, fidgety. suddenly he hops out of bed and creeps towards the sleeping form of gandalf. a sleeping gandalf lies with eyes wide open. but pippin is undeterred. merry sits up, a worried look on his face. with quick stealth, pippin lifts the wrapped palantir from gandalf\\'s grasp. pippin unwraps the palantir and as merry looks on horrified, he gazes intently into it. as pippin lays his hands on the crystal, a sickly pale light slowly spreads from the glass ball onto pippin\\'s face his eyes widen. on the steps of the golden hall, legolas turns to aragorn pippin suddenly starts to hyperventilate he staggers backwards, palantir held rigidly before him. the great eye of sauron seems to leap from the fire pippin is bathed in the fiery red light. pippin sinks to his knees, his mouth open in a soundless scream he falls backwards, powerless to release the fiery globe. gandalf wakes with a start. just as aragorn enters, and wrenches the palantir from pippin\\'s hands pippin falls to the floor aragorn spins away, reeling backwards, the palantir falling from his hands. the palantir rolls across the floor, causing everyone in the room to cower back. gandalf lifts the hobbit\\'s slumped head. pippin is trembling gandalf calms him. a lone white tree silhouetted by flames. gandalf stares at pippin with a frightening intensity. theoden stands in the

through the forest the figure of a small boy of about 5 suddenly runs across the path in front of her. the boy now stands within a vision of the majestic architecture of the great gondorian city of minas tirith. a silhouetted figure appears in the distance and moves towards the child the boy runs to the figure. arwen watches as the figure holds out its arms - swinging the laughing child into the

powers along the countryside. pippin, huddled in front of gandalf, the wind sailing through his hair. shadowfax gallops up onto a low ridge. before them is the dark mass of mount mindolluin, its tall white face whitening in the rising sun. upon its out- thrust knee is the guarded city minas tirith. with seven walls of white stone, so strong and old that it seems to have been not built, minas tirith looks carven by giants out of the bones of the earth. suddenly the sun climbs over the eastern hills, and sends forth a shaft of sunlight that gleams against th e face of the city. the tower of ecthelion stands high within the topmost walls. white banners break and flutter from the battlements in the morning breeze. shadowfax, carrying gandalf and pippin up towards the 7th level. minas

like a sharp ship\\'s prow - bisects the city from the 2nd level to the top. shadowfax arrives at a great citadel on the summit of the city - 1000 feet above the pelennor fields. gandalf and pippin dismount, leaving the guards of the citadel to tend to shadowfax. gandalf hurries off. pippin as he takes in his surroundings, his eye caught by a dead tree that stands in the middle of the court, four solemn citadel guards standing sentry around it. gandalf leads pippin across a flat court of white stones, surrounded by green lawns towards a great hall benejath the gleaming tower. \\' \\\\ gandalf lowers his voice, as they approach the tower hall. pippin, suitably chastened, nods. a long solemn hall with rows of black marble pillars. between the pillars stand a silent company of tall kings carved in cold stone. gandalf strides down the hall, with pippin following obediently behind. at the far end, upon a dais of many steps, sits a large, empty throne and on the wall behind is the image of a flowering white tree set in gems. at the foot of the dais, in a small stone chair, sits an old man, gazing at his lap denethor - the lord steward of condor. denethor does not look up as

at pippin blankly, overcome with grief. denethor gaze turns slowly on gandalf. denethor smiles at gandalf, as if amused by something. gandalf looks shocked, denethor\\'s eyes narrow. pippin, horrified. gandalf looks at denethor closely for a moment, then turns on his heel to leave, pippin follows. gandalf and pippin stride from the tower hall denethor slumps back into his seat. pippin is carefully laying out a small uniform of the royal guard on a bed. gandalf standing quietly on a balcony that overlooks the great city. pippin as he stares up at the vast night sky., gandalf watches the young hobbit. gandalf joins pippin as they look towards the distant, jagged mountains of mordor. pippin looks up at him, unnerved. gandalf gives him a small self-deprecating smile. gandalf and pippin share a quiet moment as they stare out towards the fiery sky over mordor. insert giant mumakil carrying armies upon their backs insert corsair ships sail up the river. gandalf he is almost talking to himself now like a man unable to prevent a sure disaster. insert the battle-scarred city of osgiliath - last bastion between minas tirith and mordor. gandalf looks down at pippin, he says

staring intently as if facing his enemy in .person. pippin looks up at gandalf, afraid to ask. insert frodo screaming as the morgul blade is driven into his shoulder. pippin blanches at the memory. frodo and sam clamber into a small gully beside a rough-hewn road gollum carefully.peers over the lip of the gully ___ minas morgul, a massive dead city, set upon a rocky knee at the head of the morgul valley. corrupt and loathsome, it glows with a sickly luminous light - like a corpse candle. two huge, bestial stone statues guard the bridge that leads to the city. gollum, frodo and sam hurry from their cover scampering in the shadows towards minas morgul. frodo he looks up at the hideous statues. his senses start reeling. frodo and sam look aghast at the sight of a narrow, near- vertical staircase, cut into the rock-face directly in front of the minas morgul gates. (co ntinue d) suddenly. frodo staggers across the road as if some force, other than his own will, is at work. he lurches towards the bridge towards minas morgul. sam runs after frodo, catching him in his arms as he stumbles, sam and gollum pull frodo from the bridge. frodo falls to the ground. at that moment the ground quivers, and a great rumbling noise rolls across the ground and echoes in the mountains. the cold, dull morgul valley is suddenly violent and fierce, as uprushing flame springs from mount doom. minas morgul answers a flare of livid lightning, forks of blue flame, spring up from the tower into the sullen cloud. violent fiery flashes light the cloud above mordor sharp thunder rolls across 40 miles to minas tirith. pippin looking on in frightened awe. gandalf\\'s comforting hand rests on his shoulder. sam and gollum lead frodo to the stairs. above minas morgul the sky is bright with light as the city, erupts. faces of soldiers and civilians of minas tirith as they watch from the parapets of the city. frodo and sam sink to the ground, holding their hands against their ears, as out of the city comes a rending screech shivering, rising swiftly to a piercing pitch beyond the range of hearing. the terrible cry ends, falling back through a long sickening wail, to silence. frodo slowly raises his head across the narrow valley, directly opposite the hobbits, the lord of the nazgul - the witch king - suddenly rises up out of the dead city on his fell-beast. the cavernous gate of minas morgul swings open. and. a huge army marches out. rank upon rank of armour clad orcs, moving swiftly and silently, pass close to frodo and sam in an endless stream of ragged columns. gandalf . 75,000 orcs marching to war, just below frodo and sam. the witch king swoops down the valley to join the head of his army. he vanishes into the gloom - a shadow into shadow. gollum peers out from his stony hiding place. gandalf thinking, calculating. gandalf striding back streets of the city so determined and purposeful is he, that pippin has to run to keep up. gandalf suddenly stops and looks down at pippin. gandalf kneels down and looks at pippin earnestly, his hand on pippin\\'s shoulder. gandalf watches as pippin hurries away. an ancient stone bridge which spans the ruins of east and west osgiliath - a once mighty gondorian city. ithilien rangers patrolling the

turns to leave, stops, turns back. denethor continues with his meal. faramir exits. high above minas morgul, on the small ledge next to the stairs, lie the figures of frodo, sam and gollum. sam watches a sleeping gollum suspiciously as he desperately tries to stay awake. slowly, inevitably, sam, falls asleep. gollum\\'s eyes snap open he sits up and quietly crawls towards sam\\'s knapsack.

motionless. fast cuts of screaming orcs. throughout the above sequence denethor has continued to eat. pippin finishes his bittersweet song he looks up at denethor who continues as if he has not sent

which spans both sides of osgiliath they head straight towards minas tirith. aragorn, theoden, eomer, merry, legolas and gimli gallop into a vast camp beneath the cover of trees teeming with men,

encampment below. thousands of men and horses. smoke from many small camp-fires has filled the valley with a twilight haze. aragorn turns to theoden. theoden realising what aragorn is saying - no

rohan soldiers try to quieten them. legolas and gimli move through the camp. legolas looking at a group of rohan soldiers they sit quiet and hunched no-one speaking. legolas looking toward eomer who is unsaddling his horse. gimli\\'s eyes travel to a row of ancient standing stones that mark the entrance to a road leading away from the encampment and into the mountain. aragorn stands before the road as though transfixed before him a horse whinnies and pulls at his ropes nervously. a ghostly figure seems to emerge from the gloom aragorn starts in fright as. aragorn stares down at the little dwarf. aragorn casts another look back at the ancient standing stones before following gimli. all is quiet in the encampment. eowyn kneels before merry, adjusting his helmet strap. merry exhales -

evenstar falls from her fingers at that moment, aragorn wakes, his sword quickly in his hand a guard stands in the doorway. aragorn hurries towards theoden\\'s tent. - theoden looks up as aragorn enters. theoden bows slightly to the hooded figure and leaves, shooting aragorn a strange look as he goes. the figure stands and pulls back the hood to reveal elrond. elrond\\'s face is etched with pain. elrond\\'s eyes fall to the evenstar which hangs around aragorn\\'s neck. aragorn looks at elrond in shock. a fleet of black sails moving along a silver ribbon of water . elrond hesitates a beat. a sudden wind rushes through the tent, lifting hangings, scattering maps, knocking over goblets. as aragorn looks at elrond, an image flashes in his mind\\'s eye the ghostly figure on the dimholt road. aragorn looks at elrond in shock. aragorn\\' s eyes fall to a plain black scabbard, which elrond draws from beneath his robes. elrond\\' s long white fingers draw the hilt of a sword from the scabbard to reveal a elven sword glints in the firelight. aragorn takes the sword staring at it in wonder. aragorn draws the long blade from its sheath. elrond stares hard at aragorn. a heavy silence hangs in the room. aragorn re-sheathes the sword. as aragorn readies brego for leaving eowyn approaches her temper barely held in check. aragorn looks over his shoulder at her. aragorn looks at her sadly, not wanting to hurt her. eowyn steps back at though struck she watches stricken as aragorn leaves. aragorn leads his horse through the tents towards the dimholt road. a light flares ahead.of him. a short figure steps out of the shadows pipe in hand. aragorn looks at gimli - grateful for his courage but determined to go alone. aragorn shakes his head, smiling his acceptance.

among themselves, \"what\\'s happening?\", \"where\\'s he going?\" theoden as he moves forward. theoden looks at eowyn who stands as if turned to stone she is looking up at a lightening sky the quiet before the men depart for war. eowyn turns to the king her face a blank she speaks without emotion. theoden moves towards her, taking up her hand. eowyn slowly lifts her head. theoden lifts eowyn faces to look into her eyes. aragorn, legolas and gimli make their way up a. gloomy canyon, shadowed by black fir trees. the shadowed ridges of the dwimorberg mountain rise before them. silence surrounds them, there are no birds, no wind. only the ominously muffled thud of their horses hooves on the dank fir- needles. \\' before them, at the root of the mountain, a sheer wall of rock towers. within the walls, a creepy dark door gapes like a mouth of night. signs and figures are carved above its wide arch. at that moment a chill wind seems to rush out of the doorway aragorn stares into the blackness, his hair blowing wildly. the horses rear and\\'buck\\'in terror, turning and galloping away. aragorn walking into the blackness. legolas quickly follows swallowed by the darkness. gimli

amongst the soldiers. denethor looks down at faramir\\'s unconscious body. pippin has run to faramir and bends towards him. denethor slowly turning away walking as if in a trance. denethor has reached the edge of the courtyard he stares in shocked disbelief at the vista spread out below a full view of the orc army from the top of minas\\'tirith. 75,000 orcs are spread out across the pelennor fields like a sea of black ants. trolls load the catapults with rocks. battering rams and siege towers are hauled on chains. thousands of flickering torches give the army the look of a moving city in the

in contempt. suddenly. 9 nazgul dive out of the dim sky, clad in battle armour. soldiers throw themselves down as the nazgul zoom overhead, emitting their piercing shrieks. gondorian soldiers run for shelter in panic, covering their ears. pippin cowering. mighty wooden catapults positioned within the walls of minas tirith are fired. the nazgul circle low over the city, like vultures seeking doomed

falling masonry. too late. the towers reach the walls, their doors crashing down, releasing orcs directly onto the lower levels. as the orc swarm from the tower, gandalf realises pippin has come down from the citadel. pippin looks on stunned, as a huge orc leaps towards him gandalf intercepts the beast, striking him with his staff. gandalf welds his staff, cutting through the attacking orc with ease behind him, an orc prepares to cut down gandalf pippin instinctively slashes his sword at him. gandalf turns on pippin, smiling despite himself. out of black swirling battle. smoke crawls an iron monster. a massive wheeled battering ram . 60 feet high and 150 feet long pushed by 20 huge mountain trolls a massive iron head, cast in the likeness of a snarling wolf. this is grond the battering

between columns of torn and weathered rock. ahead is a great grey wall, a last huge mass of mountain- stone and in the shadows at the base of the towering rock lies a tunnel. frodo reacts to the foul stench coming out of the black hole. smeagol sensing his plan unravelling. everything depends on frodo going inside the tunnel frodo stares into the darkness. gollum, his sparse oily hair hanging like rank weed over his hooded eyes. drawing a deep breath, frodo follows gollum into the tunnel. frodo nearly gags they continue on, deep into the dark tunnel frodo is feeling his way in the dark, following the sound ,of gollum\\'s scampering , ,. frodo follows the sound of gollum\\'s voice. he is very tired. frodo cannot see gollum in the murky tunnel. gollum is nowhere to be seen only his voice echoes back down the labyrinth of tunnels. frodo freezes. no answer, no echo, not even a tremor in the air. frodo realises with horror that gollum has deserted him. frodo breathing hard passing all manner of creatures, trussed up in evil web-like material. a bubbling hiss can be heard there is a creaking as some great jointed thing moves with slow purpose in the dark. frodo begins to run in blind panic. sam stumbles blindly down the ancient stairs, reckless and uncaring, his face pale and devastated. sam\\'s foot slips. suddenly, as if the ground has given way beneath him, sam is slipping and sliding dangerously out of control. sam thudding into a large rock, which saves him. from tumbling headlong over the precipice. something catches sam\\'s eye he stares, barely breathing. a package of lembas bread. sam looking back up the long steep stair. frodo is running blindly he falls, trapped in the sticky substance which clings to him. as he lays on the ground, unable to move, a voice comes to him as if froma distant-,, memory. frodo fumbles in his jacket, fear growing in him he pulls out the glass phial - his gift from galadriel - he holds it aloft. the phial flickers kindles into a silver flame - a bright radiant starlight. shelob the spider hisses at the light. two great clusters of many-windowed eyes protrude from her bulbous head. her legs are bent, with a 12 foot span and hairs that stick out like steel spines. her huge, swollen body, a vast bloated bag, sways and sags between her legs. her age-old black hide is knobbly and pitted, blotchy with livid marks but her belly underneath is pale and luminous. shelob beats the air with her forelegs. calling up all his remaining strength and resolution, frodo forces his legs to move he backs away - keeping his eyes on shelob. shelob crawls slowly towards him then, with sudden . hideous speed, she attacks. she lashes out with her front legs frodo is flung back the glass phial clatters to the tunnel floor, casting an eerie low light. shelob squats above frodo, her eye clusters fidgeting with hideous delight, gloating over a prey trapped beyond all hope of escape. suddenly. frodo draws sting. he slashes wildly at the giant spider hewing off the tip of a leg. shelob spasms a wild blur of thrashing legs. frodo leaps to his feet and runs - not even pausing to pick up the phial of light. with frodo as he careers blindly down narrow tunnels, gasping in the choking air looking back over his shoulder for any sign of shelob. frodo sees the tunnel exit ahead. just as he runs straight into a great cobweb. gollum on the other side of the web. frodo as he slashes wildly with sting. the shining blade of sting as it hacks through the fibrous strands. they whip and snap back into frodo\\'s face as he cuts himself free. back up the tunnel - lit by the light of galadriel - shelob\\'s heaving shadow approaches. gollum watches in mounting disbelief as sting slashes through the web disbelief turns to fear as shelob gets closer and closer, gollum quickly turns and bolts. frodo hacks at the web and with a last desperate lunge, frees himself sting is caught in the web frodo leaves the sword and throws himself through a narrow crevice. frodo stumbles out of shelob\\'s lair tumbling onto cold rock. frodo covered in cobwebs, wild-eyed and drenched in sweat - h e looks up as gollum lunges at him. gollum and frodo fight rolling on the ground towards the edge of a precipice. frodo\\'s fingers squeeze tighter around gollum\\'s throat. frodo has a sudden moment of self realisation and releases gollum, horrified at his violence. gollum cowering back coughing and spluttering. frodo looking at smeagol, in shock, he gets to his feet. smeagol stares at frodo in disbelief in a fury he lunges at frodo who falls backwards, dangerously close to the edge of the precipice - gollum tumbles over frodo\\'s body and falls to the bottom of the ravine. frodo, overcome with exhaustion, stumbles down the steep stairs of cirith ungol he is full of remorse at his treatment of sam. frodo falls t o his knees -- frodo lands on soft green grass. sun drenched of trees of fields of

deep boom. grond thuds against the minas tirith gate sending a - vibration running through the city. gandalf, on shadowfax, leads several hundred gondorian foot soldiers down through the streets. pippin watches as faramir\\'s unconscious body is carried on the stretcher by denethor\\'s servants lead by denethor it has the atmosphere of a funeral. an iron door creaks open faramir\\'s procession enters a wide vaulted chamber. the lantern lig ht throws great shadows upon the shrouded walls of a wide vaulted chamber. row upon row of marble tombs are visible in the dim light. upon each tomb lies a sleeping form, carved in stone, hands folded. denethor speaks in a hushed voice. the servants place faramir\\'s unconscious body on a stone table in the centre of the chamber. they stand, heads bowed as mourners beside a bed of death. denethor turns to his servants. booomm the gate splinters under grond\\'s mighty weight behind the gates the gondorian foot soldiers are fearful. gandalf rallies the line of bowmen as they wait in front of the great doors their courage wavering with each crashing b ow l . suddenly the fearsome head protrudes into the minas tirith. within moments the gate is smashed and giant cave trolls enter into the first circle of minas tirith, under the archway that no enemy had ever passed. rows of archers fire off a volley of arrows but the trolls continue to smash the foot soldiers with their giant clubs orcs swarm through the opening and the pitched, hand-to- hand battle spills into flames and blackened, smouldering buildings through the streets of minas tirith. with a roar, gandalf leads a counter attack on shadowfax, followed by several hundred gondorian foot \" \" soldiers. thousands of orcs swarm in through the city gates the first level is breached. frodo staggers through the pass of cirith ungol the weight of the ring, dragging at his neck. he moves forward, fueled by a grim resolve. frodo starts climbing a stone staircase that climbs through a narrow pass tall peaks rise on either side, like pillars holding up a sagging sky. frodo stays close to the rock wall, masked by shadows. behind frodo, shelob appears. with hideous stealth, she follows frodo. frodo slowly climbing the stone stairs his gaze and concentration on the orc tower. behind him, shelob lurches into a horrible scuttle down the sheer rock face. frodo suddenly senses the lurking malice he spins around before he can react, shelob viciously stabs frodo in the neck with her monstrous abdominal stinger. frodo instantly goes limp shelob\\'s legs catch him as he around him. with falls she quickly starts weaving cobwebs great dexterity, she tumbles the little hobb it over and over in her legs, binding him in web from head to toe. suddenly the razor sharp edge of a sword comes into shot. samwise gamgee stands before the giant spider - sting clutched in one hand, the shining phial in the other. shelob hisses at sam dropping frodo he rolls down the stairs in his web cocoon. sam moves forward, a fell light in his normally friendly eyes sam swings the small sword slashing upward. sam ducks inside the arch of her legs and stabs sting into one of her eye clusters. shelob screams, her mandibles thrashing wildly, green ooze trickling from her wounded eye. with hind legs, shelob picks sam off the ground and tosses him backwards. sam lands heavily and shelob pounces. shelob heaves the great bag of her belly high above sam\\'s head. as she splays her legs to drive her huge bulk down on him, sam lifts the elven blade above his head, holding it with two hands. sting slides into shelob\\'s soft underbelly. a shudder runs through her. heaving up. again, she wrenches herself away from the pain her limbs writhing beneath her. jerking and quivering, shelob crawls to her hole, leaving a trail of green-yellow slime. she squeezes down the hole and disappears the sound of her bubbling misery fades. sam races to frodo. sam rips cobwebs away from frodo\\'s head his face is deathly pale. frodo\\'s pale, lifeless face. frodo\\'s head lolls lifelessly in sam\\'s arms. frodo staring, unmoving. sam lays his face on frodo\\'s chest weeping softly. sting\\'s blade glows blue. tramping feet approach clinking metal harsh shouts. sam looks up looks back down frodo. sam looks up at the orc tower and then at sting which is glowing blue. orcs approach - sam must make a decision. a small party of orcs and uruk-hai heading down the stairs from the watch tower shagrat leads the uruk-hai, and gorbag leads the orcs. gorbag spies frodo\\'s body. gorbag peer curiously at frodo as he leans down and pokes at frodo\\'s lifeless body. the orcs grunt as they lift frodo and carry him back towards the watch tower. orc laughter frodo is carried up the steep stairs  from the shadows pippin watches, aghast, as faramir is lain on a funeral pyre. denethor kisses faramir\\'s sweating, fevered brow. bundles of dried firewood are being stacked around

of mount milldolluin, they dimly echo - war horns of the west rohan has come. gothmog turns at the sound of the distant horns. minas tirith lies less than a mile away, down a gentle slope. over 50,000 orcs are swarming around the base of the city thick black smoke belches from within it. merry blanches with fear eowyn puts a comforting hand on his shoulder. the orcs prepare for battle. theoden

lances in readiness. eowyn, her arm around merry before her. merry looks on in shock. as theoden rides past the ranks of soldiers he runs his lance along their spears the noise echoes through the ranks as the weapons of other riders clatter in response. t h eo de n f ac es hi s e ne my . merry is swept up in the emotion . he whips out his little sword. all the horns of the rohirrim burst blast

astride faramir, pouring oil over his own head it runs through his hair and down his face, quickly soaking his robes. faramir, his eyes flicker open. as he tries to focus through his delirium, oil splashes onto his chest and face. bundles of oil-soaked wood are stacked all around them. servants are holding flaming torches, awaiting their orders denethor nods to them the servants approach the pyre, torches held firmly. at that moment gandalf and pippin burst into the hallows, astride shadowfax. the fearful servants back away from the pyre. whoosh. the pyre ignites. gandalf gallops toward the pyre, knocking denethor to his feet pippin leaps from shadowfax onto the burning pyre. with a desperate strength, pippin pushes faramir off the burning pyre they tumble down the bundles of wood, onto the floor. pippin douses flames on faramir\\'s clothing. denethor screams with rage. denethor leaps across the pyre, ripping and tugging at pippin. fire quickly spreads up denethor\\'s oil-soaked back as he hauls pippin off faramir. shadowfax rears up and strikes at denethor who falls back onto the pyre . denethor he looks into his son\\'s eyes for a brief moment sanity returns. flames begin to engulf denethor. gandalf pulls pippin to safety they look in horror as. suddenly. denethor lurches off the pyre. now a screaming, unguided ball of flame, he runs across the chamber, disappearing out of the door. denethor runs across the white court atop minas tirith and plummets straight over the 700 foot sheer drop into the flaming city below. denethor\\'s death plunge to the rohirrim gaining the upper hand - vast numbers of orcs are slain, or are fleeing. theoden stands proud in his saddle, yelling to his rohirrim. theoden his look of joy turns to horror. \" across the vast sea of

pound on its wooden doors with huge hammers. wood splinters the doors are near breaking point. gandalf and pippin sit on stone steps both covered in sweat and grime, bone-weary from fighting, spirits and hearts bruised. pippin looks towards the wooden gates at which a number of soldiers continue to build a barricade. gandalf looks at the small hobbit a beat. gandalf looks down to see pippin looking up at him with fear in his eyes. gandalf breaks off, lost in reverie. pippin stares up at the old wizard\\'s face, softened, quiet and full of peace. boom. gandalf and pippin\\'s faces turn as the wooden doors shudder under another blow. the battlefield is in chaos as mumakil decimate the valiant rohirrim. theoden tries to rally his men amid the sea of crying men and neighing horses.

can see. above minas tirith blinding sun rays break through the low clouds. gandalf, legolas, gimli and pippin watch as aragorn walks slowly across the field of battle towards the hideous ghouls. the army of the dead slowly dissolve into dust, and are immediately swept away by the four winds. aragorn turns to gandalf who bows his head in homage. pippin running through the ruin of the battle towards a small figure slumped on the ground. merry stares unseeing at pippin horror and shock erasing all other memories from merry\\'s mind tears fall down pippin\\'s face as he looks on his friend.

throat. the ring has gone. gorbag grabs for the mithril vest. gorbag draws his sword, but shagrat kicks him backwards with his foot. gorbag falls through a trap door leading to the floor below. gorbag

landing on top of uruk-hai and orcs in the courtyard below. within moments, a brutal civil war breaks out between the two companies stationed in cirith ungol. sam hurries towards the gate, fearful for frodo. sam is confronted with the sight of over 50 slaughtered orc and uruk-hai, strewn over the courtyard. sam pounds up the staircase he suddenly pauses. several uruk-hai are running down towards him. he grips sting and continues charging up - screaming at the top of his lungs. the four uruks they see a huge distorted shadow on the wall in front of them. they turn around and flee in terror back to the top of the stairs. sam appears - and before the uruk-hai can fully regain their wits - he slays three yelling frodo struggling against his bonds, as gorbag climbs back into the room with vengeance in his evil eyes. gorbag grabs frodo\\'s hair and pulls his head back, exposing his neck. he pulls out his sword, ready to cut frodo\\'s throat. suddenly. gorbag gasps as sting is rammed into his back by sam. gorbag falls dead. frodo humbled by sam\\'s unswerving loyalty. sam quickly cuts frodo free. sam pulls the ring from his pocket. frodo looks at sam amazed his eyes drop to the rn

the ring back around his nc . ek frodo looks at sam, pain in his eyes. sam looks down at frodo his plain hobbit face full of compassion. sam\\'s resolve hardens, a new strength takes hold. frodo and sam are now dressed in foul-looking orc gear. frodo and sam turn east and walk over the summit of cirith ungol into mordor. frodo and sam they stop dead staring ahead mount doom 50 m,iles away - across the barren gorgoroth plateau - the mountain is erupting streams of ash and lava high into the air, lighting the low cloud blanket of mordor with a flickering orange wash. with immense trepidation, frodo and sam head down the steep path into the dark kingdom. two tiny figures in a bleak, foreboding landscape. before them lies the plain of gorgoroth their eyes are drawn to the ominous silhouette of mount doom. frodo\\'s eyes travel down towards the hundreds of fires which glow on the plains beneath them thousands upon thousands of orcs are encamped there . their eyes are drawn to a dark looming shape barad-dur a red light seems to sweep across the plain. sam cannot see what frodo sees. gently, he urges frodo on. gandalf stands in the tower hall seemingly alone he speaks quietly, doubt and fear edge his voice. he turns and crosses the hall to reveal the presence of gimli, legolas, eomer and aragorn. aragorn, his back to gandalf. gandalf - still troubled, still worried. gimli sits insolently on the seat of the steward. gandalf looks across at the dwarf his face ashen. aragorn turns around suddenly. gandalf looks up sharply at aragorn. at this, gimli chokes on his pipe eomer steps forward. gandalf speaks in a low tone to aragorn. aragorn wearing a breast plate emblazoned with the white tree. he rides at the head of a column of 500 foot soldiers from rohan and condor leading them from the ruins of osgiliath. gandalf, legolas, gimli, eomer, merry and pippin ride directly behind him. ahead of them the mountains of mordor. great armies of orc and uruk-hai stream across the plains from mordor. the volcanic wasteland of the gorgoroth foothills. frodo and sam, still disguised in the orc armour, slide down scree bank and land on the road below their attention is fixed on the plain below thousands of orcs can be seen marching away from mt. doom. frodo and sam moving across a hellish dry landscape of twisted volcanic rock and steaming fissures. 40 miles away, mount doom rises out of the plain its feet founded in ashen ruin, its huge cone rising to a great height, where its reeking head is swathed in cloud. aragorn\\'s force of 500 approaches the great black gates of mordor. he positions his troops about half a mile from the gates. frodo slumped against a rock he tries to drink from his water bottle but finds it empty. frodo gratefully takes a small sip from sam\\'s bottle hands it back. a moment of eye contact between frodo and sam as they acknowledge what lies ahead. sam offers frodo his hand and pulls him up. at the black gates, aragorn musters his men. frodo and sam staggering across the tortured landscape they are no longer wearing the orc armour. frodo is walking half-bowed, often stumbling as if his eyes not longer see the way before his feet. his right hand is pressed against his chest supporting a heavy weight. his left hand often rises, as if to ward off some invisible blow. sam watches him, concern etched across his face. frodo as a malevolent voice in his head calls to him \"baggins - baggins\". sam looking behind him in time to see. a ray of red light stabs through the gloom and begins to sweep over the barren landscape. sam throws himself to the ground frodo turns to the light, unable to stop himself. frodo crumpling to the ground as the red light hits him like a searchlight. all is quiet no sign of the enemy. gandalf watchful alert. he nods at aragorn. aragorn, gandalf, legolas, gimli, eomer, merry and pippin galloping towards the black gates. they pull up less than 50 yards from the towering gates. frodo is slumped on the ground, unable to move. aragorn moves his horse forward. from behind the huge gates, the terrifying chanting and the clanging of the armour of thousands. with the sound of tortured metal, the massive gates begin to open legolas, merry and eomer look on in trepidation. with the eye of sauron sweeping the plains around them, sam gets to his feet. the black gates of mordor swing open. sauron\\'s army of 300,000 orcs march out. aragorn, gandalf, legolas, gimli, eomer, merry and pippin gallop back towards their small army as the orc masses

massive orc army marching towards aragorn\\'s men. aragorn\\'s men starting to waver as the orcs encircle them. some men are backing away losing their nerve. aragorn gallops in front of his army. aragorn he seems to fix each and everyone of his men with his eyes. aragorn holds anduril aloft. frodo and sam are climbing the face of mount doom. the landscape is violent red heat hisses out of fissures, the rock is jagged razor sharp ash blankets the land. red lightning forks across the sky with a deafening crack. frodo and sam\\'s feet dragging across the ash their parched lips sweating, dusty faces. frodo trips falls face-first into the dust sam drops beside him. of aragorn\\'s army, totally surrounded by 300,000 orcs poised for the order to attack. frodo slowly lifts his head and looks up. frodo\\'s looking .straight up the steep slopes of mount doom a huge mass of ash and slag and burned stone. frodo starts to crawl on his hands and knees. he hauls himself a few pitiful feet before slumping in the ash. gimli as he surveys the army of mordor. gimli looks up into the eyes of legolas, with whom he has shared so much. the gruff dwarf smiles quietly. legolas drops his hand on gimli\\'s shoulder slowly they turn and face the enemy together. sam crawls to frodo who lies slumped against the rock-face he turns him over, holding him in his arms. frodo shuts his eyes, his breath coming in gasps. with that, sam lifts frodo on to his shoulders and starts to climb mount doom. his plain hobbit-face grows stern, almost grim, as the will hardens in him. two tiny hobbits on the endless shale slopes of the mountain. aragorn and company watch as they are surrounded by a tide of orcs. aragorn raises anduril in the broad sweep as he walks forward he turns to face the others. quiet resolve written on aragorn\\'s face as he looks into the eyes of the remaining members of the fellowship. aragorn turning, sword-raised, he charges forward. there is a moment of silence no-one else moves suddenly a shout goes up. pippin and merry charging forward the rest of the men following. aragorn crashing head on into a line of orcs. the blade of anduril flashing as aragorn hacks at orcs. like a small grey insect, sam creeps up the slope with frodo on his back foot by foot. the mantling cloud swirls, revealing the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of barad-dur, the dark tower, in the distance. sam staggering under frodo\\'s weight strong ash- laden winds are buffeting him as he slowly climbs mount doom. the plain of gorgoroth lies 1000 feet below, wrapped in fume and shadow. a tremor ripples through the ground a red flame explodes into the sky. sam looks up - fearful the mountain could explode at any moment. through the thick, fume-laden air a set of stairs can be made out. sam can\\'t believe it - relief and joy flood through him. smack out of nowhere the figure of smeagol crashes into them sending sam and frodo sprawling. smeagol pounces on frodo his fingers wrapping around his throat, snapping frodo\\'s neck from side to side. frodo as he struggles to unlock the bony, white fingers around his neck but smeagol\\'s grip is too strong. smeagol\\'s fingers tightening around frodo\\'s neck - squeezing the life out of him. frodo comes to. the battle between men and orcs rages on from mordor, high overhead, the nazgul fly out into the fray. all the old hatred between

he cuts smeagol across the stomach. smeagol staggers back, screaming with pain. sam looks around desperately for frodo. frodo has gone. frodo running up the mountain. fellowship fight bravely a hideous screech rends the air. gandalf looks up to a nazgul diving straight toward him. gandalf eyes flicker as a small moth flutters across his line of sight. another cry rends the air as. smack. the giant eagle, gwahir, smashes into the fellbeast, it\\'s claws ripping into the hideous monster\\'s neck. pippin in the midst of battle looks up. above the battle attack formation, more eagles appear. pippin (cont\\'d) the eagles are coming. the eagles are coming. the eagles engage the nazgul. sam is gasping, his lungs exploding as he races up the slopes of mount doom searching for frodo. sam arriving at the stone doorway of sammath naur leading into the mountain. sam staggers into it. sam flinches against the fierce heat blasting down the tunnel. sam lurches forward towards an orange glow deep in the heart of the mountain. the heat is almost unbearable sam sees frodo in the distance. frodo is standing on the edge of the crack of doom a deep lava filled chasm, in the very heart of ancient sauron\\'s forges, the greatest in middle-earth. the raging orange glare from the chasm turns frodo into a black silhouette standing tense and still. frodo holds the ring in his hand he raises it, holding it over the bubbling lava far below.- frodo a strange expression on his face. the hum of the ring grows louder and louder. frodo pulls the ring close to his body as he turns to sam. frodo looks at sam, the ring has finally taken him. sam screams as. frodo puts the ring on. he vanishes. with a storm of wings, the nazgul wheel around and hurtle towards mount doom. in the midst of the battle - gandalf realising frodo has been seen. sam is screaming for frodo. footprints moving across the ash covered cavern floor. suddenly. gollum smashes a rock down on sam\\'s head, knocking him to the ground. gollum leaps on to the invisible frodo. frodo\\'s footprints staggering about under gollum\\'s weight. gollum clawing frantically, riding on the back of the invisible frodo. aragorn turns

falls\\'back, still clinging valiantly to the rock with his good hand. frodo looks at sam imploringly. frodo reaches up once more and this time sam grasps his hand tightly . the ring sits on the river of lava for a brief moment, then sinks away. the eye of sauron. across the great plains - mount doom is clearly imploding. on the battlefield, all eyes turn to mount doom. the cave troll, with aragorn at his mercy, is distracted by the sounds emanating from mordor he turns in terror and runs off. the fellowship turn to watch as the massive dark tower of sauron shakes itself to pieces. towers fall and walls crumble vast spires of smoke and spouting steam billow up. the foundations explode apart. the black gates collapse in a huge cloud of ash. the company watch as mount doom explodes the reason for their misery is clear it\\'s plain frodo and sam can never survive the cataclysm. the volcano is erupting, fire belches from it\\'s riven summit, sending lava streaming down it\\'s sides. frodo and sam stagger out of the sammath naur door all around ash and molten rocks fall. the skies burst into thunder, seared with lightning. the screaming nazgul fall from the sky in flames. the ground is shaking so violently that frodo and sam can barely stand. frodo stumbles sam helps him up frodo smiles. sam looks down at frodo frodo\\'s face is at peace his burden destroyed. frodo and sam crawl

hugging frodo. gimli and legolas enter the room their joy is plain. aragorn joins them - the fellowship is complete. finally frodo\\'s eyes fall upon a figure standing apart from the others it is sam. frodo\\'s and sam\\'s eyes meet. sweeping over the minas tirith walls, racing towards the top of the city through a blizzard of white flower petals. minas tirith is restored it gleams white in the bright sun. to reveal the court of the kings, crowded with 4000 people cramming the wide path leading to the tower hall. the crown of condor glints in the brilliant sunshine. gandalf places the crown upon aragorn\\'s head. aragorn smiles up at gandalf. aragorn slowly rises, turning to face the crowd, who cheer and clap for their king. the cheers of his people are deafening. aragorn sings for his people then walks in slow procession down the white paved path as the crowd bow their heads in respect to their new king. aragorn passes eowyn and faramir who bow before him eomer steps forward to bow in respect. trumpets sound as a procession of elves, dressed in shimmering silvers and whites, led by legolas approach the king legolas gestures behind him. aragorn\\'s eyes scan amongst the elves a

spring into frodo\\'s eyes. he clutches sam\\'s shoulder as 4000 people pay homage to the courage of two little hobbits from the shire. camera rises into the air away from the crowded citadel, until minas tirith becomes a speck in the landscape. dissolving into the parchment map of middle-earth slowly drifting across the map towards the west. revealing hobbiton bathed in a warm sunset as frodo, sam, merry and pippin ride into shot on ponies past odo proudfoot who shakes his head at the strangeness of their appearance. frodo brings a round of drinks to the table. the four friends look at each

winces with a sharp gasp of pain he puts the pen down and clutches at his shoulder. sam has entered the room and stands behind frodo. frodo he is drawn and pale. sam at a loss for words. his eyes fall to the book \\' to frodo\\'s handwriting lyrical music over. a cold winter\\'s morning out of the fog rattles a small covered wagon gandalf is at the reins. frodo, sam, merry and pippin are waiting on ponies for the wagon all are wearing their grey elven robes. gandalf arrives in his cart. the wagon trundles along at a sedate pace. sam, merry and pippin ride behind, leading frodo\\'s empty pony. frodo is sitting in the wagon his arm around his uncle bilbo. bilbo is extremely old and frail. he is dozing his head slumped. bilbo nods back to sleep frodo rests his head against him. frodo, walking arm-in-arm with bilbo through a beautiful elven boat-house gandalf follows with merry, pippin and sam. as bilbo looks up, he is stung by the beauty before hm i passing under a beautiful elven archway. to reveal a white ship, ready to depart from a white stone dock. elrond, celeborn and galadriel are waiting for them. bilbo bows in acknowledgement to elrond, celeborn and galadriel, who return his greeting. bilbo walks down toward the boat and boards with elrond. frodo looks up galadriel is watching him. she smiles, turns and boards the boat. gandalf kneels before sam, merry and pippin - who are all looking tearful. there is great sadness merry sniffles loudly. gandalf looks at frodo then turns and slowly walks towards the gangplank to board the ship. frodo turns to sam. sam looks down frodo is holding bilbo\\'s red journal out towards him. sam is sobbing merry and pippin are distraught. frodo hugs merry and pippin, and last of all sam and climbs on board the ship. frodo a look of wonderment crosses his face as he steps forward and accepts gandalf\\'s hand finally released from his pain, care falls from his face he is the young frodo we first met so long ago. sam, merry and pippin comfort each other as the white ship glides away from the dock. sam walks up the path towards his house. a little girl toddles up to greet him. he hugs his daughter. rosie cotton steps up and kisses sam on the cheek she gives him a tiny baby boy to cradle. sam with his family he draws a deep breath sam looks at his lovely family with great happiness, tinged with a little sadness. sam and rosie take the children\\'s hands and enter bagshot the bright yellow doorway closes behind them.

       "\" you're late. it's wonderful to see you, gandalf! you know bilbo. he's got the whole piece in an uproar. half the shire's been invited. and the rest of them are turning up anyway. to tell you the truth, bilbo's been a bit odd lateiy. i mean, more than usual. he's taken to locking himself in his study. he spends hours and hours poring over old maps when he thinks i'm not looking. he's up to something. all right, then. keep your secrets. but i know you have something to do with it. before you came along, we bagginses were very well thought of. never had any adventures or did anything unexpected. whatever you did, you've been officially labeled a disturber of the peace. gandalf? i'm glad you're back. go on, sam. ask rosie for a dance. oh, no, you don't. go on! bilbo? bilbo, have you been at the gaffer's home brew? bilbo. bilbo, watch out for the dragon! speech! bilbo! bilbo! he's gone, hasn't he? he talked for so long about leaving  i didn't think he'd really do it. gandalf? where are you going? what things? you've only just arrived. i don't understand. and proud of it. cheers, gaffer. don't worry, sam. rosie knows an idiot when she sees one. good night, sam. what are you doing? nothing. there's nothing. wait. there are markings. it's some form of elvish. i can't read it. mordor! bilbo found it. in gollum's cave. but he was destroyed. sauron was destroyed. all right. we put it away. we keep it hidden. we never speak of it again. no one knows it's here, do they? do they, gandalf? shire. baggins. but that would lead them here! take it, gandalf! take it! you must take it! i'm giving it to you! but it cannot stay in the shire! what must i do? where? where do i go? bree. what about you? and the ring will be safe there? i can cut across country easily enough. this is what? come on, sam. remember what bilbo used to say: “it's a dangerous business, frodo.” sam. wood-elves. they're going to the harbor beyond the white towers. to the grey havens. never to return. just shut your eyes  and imagine you're back in your own bed  with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow. me neither, sam. what are you taking about? what did he say? sam, we're still in the shire. what could possibly happen? what's the meaning of this? i think we should get off the road. get off the road! quick! nothing. i have to leave the shire. sam and i must get to bree. go! how far to the nearest crossing? come on. we're heading for the prancing pony. we wish to stay at the inn. our business is our own. excuse me. underhill. my name's underhill. we're friends of gandalf the grey. can you tell him we've arrived? sam  he'll be here. he'll come. excuse me. that man in the corner. who is he? strider. pippin! what do you want? i carry nothing. who are you? yes. what are they? where are you taking us? i think a servant of the enemy would look fairer  and feel fouler. we have no choice but to trust him. who is she? this woman you sing of. what happened to her? what are you doing?! put it out, you fools! put it out! go! oh, sam. gandalf! where am i? gandalf! what happened, gandalf? why didn't you meet us? gandalf? what is it? sam. bilbo! bilbo. there and back again a hobbit's tale, by bilbo baggins.'' this is wonderful. i miss the shire. i spent all my childhood pretending i was off somewhere else. off with you, on one of your adventures. but my own adventure turned out to be quite different. i'm not like you, bilbo. packed already? i thought you wanted to see the elves. more than anything. you are right, sam. we did what we set out to do. the ring will be safe in rivendell. i am ready to go home. i will take it. i will take it. i will take the ring to mordor. though  i do not know the way. it's so light. mordor, gandalf, is it left or right? we will go through the mines. better than it was. who then do i trust? what do you mean? it's a riddle. “speak 'friend' and enter.” what's the elvish word for “friend”? help! help! there's something down there. gollum? he escaped the dungeons of barad-dûr? it's a pity bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance. i wish the ring had never come to me. i wish none of this had happened. aragorn! aragorn! i'm all right. i'm not hurt. gandalf! gandalf! no! what will i see? if you ask it of me  i will give you the one ring. i cannot do this alone. then i know what i must do. it's just  i'm afraid to do it. no, sam. i'm all right. you can't help me, sam. not this time. get some sleep. i know what you would say. it would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart. there is no other way. no. you are not yourself. no! no. it has taken boromir. stay away! can you protect me from yourself? would you destroy it? i know. look after the others. especially sam. he will not understand. i wish the ring had never come to me. i wish none of this had happened. no, sam. go back, sam! i'm going to mordor alone. you can't swim! sam! sam! oh sam. come on. mordor. i hope the others find a safer road. i don't suppose we'll ever see them again. sam  i'm glad you're with me.  gandalf! gandalf! no! gandalf! gandalf! nothing. just a dream. no! don't look down, sam! just keep going! i think i've found the bottom. what's in this? roast chicken?! sam. my dear sam. it is special. it's a little bit of home. we can't leave this here for someone to follow us down. real elvish rope. he didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, sam  but they did. it's getting heavier. what food have we got left? nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, sam? it's because we've been here before. we're going in circles. yes. i can smell it. we're not alone. this is sting. you've seen it before  haven't you, gollum? release him or i'll cut your throat. maybe he does deserve to die. but now that i see him, i do pity him. there's no promise you can make that i can trust. the ring is treacherous. it will hold you to your word. sam! you know the way to mordor? you've been there before? you will lead us to the black gate. here. don't touch me! gollum? gollum! what did you say? who are you? gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk. he said your life was a sad story. you were not so very different from a hobbit once. were you? smeagol. that was your name once, wasn't it? a long time ago. i did. sam, no! i do not ask you to come with me, sam. now! are you saying there's another way into mordor? he's led us this far, sam. he's been true to his word. lead the way, smeagol. why do you do that? call him names. run him down all the time. you have no idea what it did to him  what it's still doing to him. i want to help him, sam. because i have to believe he can come back. what do you know about it? nothing! i'm sorry, sam. i don't know why i said that. i know what i have to do, sam. the ring was entrusted to me. it's my task. mine! my own! we've got to get moving. come on, sam. smeagol? we've lingered here too long. come on, sam. we are bound to an errand of secrecy. those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us. we are hobbits of the shire. frodo baggins is my name, and this is samwise gamgee. there was no other. we set out from rivendell with seven companions. one we lost in moria  two were my kin  a dwarf there was also. and an elf and two men. aragorn, son of arathorn, and boromir of gondor. yes. for my part. dead? how? when? if something has happened to boromir, we would have you tell us. wait. this creature is bound to me. and i to him. he is our guide. please  let me go down to him. smeagol. master is here. come, smeagol. trust master. come. smeagol, you must trust master. follow me. come on. come. come, smeagol. nice smeagol. that's it. come on. don't hurt him! smeagol, don't struggle. smeagol, listen to me. i can't. you were right, sam. you tried to tell me but  i'm sorry. the ring's taking me, sam. if i put it on  he'll find me. he'll see. no! the ring will not save gondor. it has only the power to destroy. please  let me go. faramir! you must let me go! it's calling to him, sam. his eye is almost on me. they're here. they've come. i can't do this, sam. what are we holding on to, sam? gollum says there's a path  near minas morgul that climbs up into the mountains. i must. thank you. what? well, you've left out one of the chief characters: samwise the brave. i want to hear more about sam. frodo wouldn't have got far without sam. so was i. smeagol? smeagol?  no. it isn't. it isn't midday yet. the days are growing darker. what about you? sam. for what? no, sam! leave him alone! sam! you scare him off, we're lost! i'm not sending him away. we can't do this by ourselves, sam. not without a guide. i need you on my side. i know, sam. i know. trust me. come, smeagol. it's just a feeling. i don't think i'll be coming back. i think these lands were once part of the kingdom of gondor. long ago, when there was a king. they're calling me. i can feel his blade. what was that about? it's dark still. what? that's all we have left. he doesn't eat it. he can't have taken it. sam! stop it! sam! sam! no! i'm all right. get away! no, sam. it's you. i'm sorry, sam. you can't help me anymore. go home. what is this place? now that i'm here, i don't think i want to. i can't go back. what's that smell? smeagol? it's sticky. what is it? smeagol? smeagol! smeagol! sam. hail earendil brightest of the stars! no! i have to destroy it, smeagol. i have to destroy it for both our sakes. i'm so sorry, sam. i'm so sorry. sam! oh, sam, i'm so sorry. sorry for everything. it's too late. it's over. they've taken it. sam  they took the ring. give it to me. give me the ring, sam. sam. give me the ring. you must understand. the ring is my burden. it will destroy you, sam. there are so many of them. we'll never get through unseen. it's him, the eye. sam, help me. it's so heavy. hit me. hit me, sam. start fighting. go, sam. now! i can't  i can't i can't manage the ring, sam. it's it's  it's such a weight to carry. it's  such a weight. there will be none left for the return journey. no, sam. i can't recall the taste of food  nor the sound of water  nor the touch of grass. i'm  naked in the dark. there's there's nothing. no veil between me and the wheel of fire. i can see him  with my waking eyes. you swore! you swore on the precious! smeagol promised! i'm here, sam. the ring is mine. it's gone. it's done. i can see the shire. the brandywine river. bag end. gandalf's fireworks. the lights in the party tree. i'm glad to be with you, samwise gamgee  here at the end of all things. gandalf? gimli! and thus it was. a fourth age of middle-earth began. and the fellowship of the ring  though eternally bound by friendship and love  was ended. thirteen months to the day since gandalf sent us on our long journey  we found ourselves looking upon a familiar sight. we were home. how do you pick up the threads of an old life? how do you go on  when in your heart you begin to understand  there is no going back? there are some things that time cannot mend  some hurts that go too deep  that have taken hold. it's been four years to the day since weathertop, sam. it's never really healed. not quite. there's room for a little more. bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end  that each of us must come and go in the telling. bilbo's story was now over. there would be no more journeys for him  save one. to the harbor, bilbo. the elves have accorded you a special honor  a place on the last ship to leave middle-earth. i'm sorry, uncle. i'm afraid i lost it. we set out to save the shire, sam. and it has been saved. but not for me. the last pages are for you, sam. my dear sam: you cannot always be torn in two. you will have to be one and whole for many years. you have so much to enjoy and to be and to do. your part in the story will go on.\""

       "\" down from the door where it began and i must follow if i can the road goes ever on and on down from the door where it began now far ahead the road has gone and i must follow if i can a wizard is never late, frodo baggins. nor is he early. he arrives precisely when he means to. you didn't think i'd miss your uncle bilbo's birthday? so how is the old rascal? i hear it's going to be a party of special magnificence. well, that should please him. what? good gracious me. indeed. if you're referring to the incident with the dragon. i was barely involved. all i did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door. oh, really? so am i, dear boy. so am i. whoa, whoa. and what about very old friends? bilbo baggins. good to see you. 111 years old! who would believe it? you haven't aged a day. just tea, thank you. just tea, thank you. no, not at all. so you mean to go through with your plan? frodo suspects something. you will tell him, won't you? he's very fond of you. whoa up they go! meriadoc brandybuck and peregrin took. i might've known. i suppose you think that was terribly clever. there are many magic rings in this world, bilbo baggins  and none of them should be used lightly. two eyes. as often as i can spare them. what about this ring of yours? is that staying too? i think you should leave the ring behind, bilbo. is that so hard? there's no need to get angry. precious? it's been called that before, but not by you. i think you've had that ring quite long enough. bilbo baggins! do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks. i am not trying to rob you. i'm trying to help you. all your long years, we've been friends. trust me as you once did. let it go. bilbo. the ring is still in your pocket. and i'm sure you will, my dear friend. goodbye, dear bilbo. until our next meeting. riddles in the dark. my precious. precious. bilbo's ring. he's gone to stay with the elves. he's left you bag end. along with all his possessions. the ring is yours now. put it somewhere out of sight. there are some things that i must see to. questions. questions that need answering. neither do i. keep it secret. keep it safe. “the year 3434 of the second age. here follows the account of isildur, high king of gondor  and the finding of the ring of power.” “it has come to me. the one ring. it shall be an heirloom of my kingdom. all those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate  for i will risk no hurt to the ring. it is precious to me  though i buy it with great pain. the markings upon the band begin to fade. the writing, which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared. a secret now that only fire can tell.” is it secret? is it safe? hold out your hand, frodo. it's quite cool. what can you see? can you see anything? there are few who can. the language is that of mordor, which i will not utter here. in the common tongue, it says: “one ring to rule them all  one ring to find them  one ring to bring them all  and in the darkness bind them.” this is the one ring  forged by the dark lord sauron in the fires of mount doom. taken by isiidur from the hand of sauron himself. yes. for 60 years, the ring lay quiet in bilbo's keeping  prolonging his life, delaying old age. but no longer, frodo. evil is stirring in mordor. the ring has awoken. it's heard its master's call. no, frodo. the spirit of sauron endured. his life force is bound to the ring, and the ring survived. sauron has returned. his orcs have multiplied. his fortress at barad-dã»r is rebuilt in the land of mordor. sauron needs only this ring to cover all the lands in a second darkness. he is seeking it. seeking it — all his thought is bent on it. for the ring yearns above all else  to return to the hand of its master. they are one  the ring and the dark lord. frodo  he must never find it. there is one other who knew that bilbo had the ring. i looked everywhere for the creature gollum. but the enemy found him first. i don't know how long they tortured him. but amidst the endless screams and inane babble, they discerned two words: no, frodo. you cannot offer me this ring! don't tempt me, frodo! i dare not take it. not even to keep it safe. understand, frodo  i would use this ring from a desire to do good. but through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine. no no, it can't. you must leave. and leave quickly. get out of the shire. make for the village of bree. i'll be waiting for you  at the inn of the prancing pony. i don't know, frodo. i don't have any answers. i must see the head of my order. he is both wise and powerful. trust me, frodo. he'll know what to do. you'll have to leave the name of baggins behind you. that name is not safe outside the shire. travel only by day. and stay off the road. my dear frodo. hobbits really are amazing creatures. you can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month. and yet, after a hundred years  they can still surprise you. get down. confound it all, samwise gamgee! have you been eavesdropping? a little late for trimming the verge, don't you think? what did you hear? speak! no? perhaps not. i've thought of a better use for you. come along, samwise. keep up. be careful, both of you. the enemy has many spies in his service: birds, beasts. is it safe? never put it on  for the agents of the dark lord will be drawn to its power. always remember, frodo  the ring is trying to get back to its master. it wants to be found. saruman. beyond any doubt. all these long years, it was in the shire. under my very nose. but we still have time. time enough to counter sauron if we act quickly. the eye of sauron. you know this? how? a palantir is a dangerous tool, saruman. they are not all accounted for, the lost seeing-stones. we do not know who else may be watching. the nine? they've reached the shire? frodo! tell me  friend  when did saruman the wise abandon reason for madness? you are in the house of elrond. and it is 10 o'clock in the morning on october 24th, if you want to know. yes, i'm here. and you're lucky to be here too. a few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid. but you have some strength in you, my dear hobbit. i am sorry, frodo. i was delayed. a friendship with saruman is not lightly thrown aside. there is only one lord of the ring. only one who can bend it to his will. and he does not share power. nothing, frodo. sam has hardly left your side. by the skills of lord elrond, you're beginning to mend. that wound will never fully heal. he will carry it the rest of his life. it is a burden he should never have had to bear. we can ask no more of frodo. his treachery runs deeper than you know. by foul craft, saruman has crossed orcs with goblin-men. he's breeding an army in the caverns of isengard. an army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed. saruman is coming for the ring. it is in men that we must place our hope. there is one who could unite them. one who could reclaim the throne of gondor. “one ring to rule them all  one ring to find them  one ring to bring them all  and in the darkness bind them.” i do not ask your pardon, master elrond  for the black speech of mordor  may yet be heard  in every corner of the west! the ring is altogether evil. aragorn is right. we cannot use it. do you not understand? while you bicker amongst yourselves, sauron's power grows! none can escape it! you'll all be destroyed! i will help you bear this burden, frodo baggins  as long as it is yours to bear. the fellowship awaits the ring-bearer. left. we must hold to this course, west of the misty mountains, for 40 days. if our luck holds, the gap of rohan will still be open to us. from there, our road turns east to mordor. no gimli, i would not take the road through moria unless i had no other choice. spies of saruman. the passage south is being watched. we must take the pass of caradhras. it's saruman! no! sleep caradhras, be still, lie still, hold your wrath! let the ring-bearer decide. frodo? so be it. frodo, come and help an old man. how is your shoulder? and the ring? you feel its power growing, don't you? i've felt it too. you must be careful now. evil will be drawn to you from outside the fellowship. and, i fear, from within. you must trust yourself. trust your own strengths. there are many powers in this world  for good or for evil. some are greater than i am. and against some i have not yet been tested. yes, gimli, their own masters cannot find them if their secrets are forgotten. well, let's see. “moon-star” it mirrors only starlight and moonlight. it reads; “the doors of durin, lord of moria. speak, friend, and enter.” oh it's quite simple. if you are a friend, you speak the password and the doors will open. gate of the elves, open now for me! doorway of the dwarf-folk  listen to the word of my tongue. i once knew every spell in all the tongues of elves  men and orcs. knock your head against these doors, peregrin took! and if that does not shatter them  and i am allowed a little peace from foolish questions  i will try to find the opening words. gate of elves  listen to my word  threshold of dwarves! doorway of the dwarf-folk  oh, it's useless. mellon. into the mines! we now have but one choice. we must face the long dark of moria. be on your guard. there are older and fouler things than orcs  in the deep places of the world. quietly now. it's a four-day journey to the other side. let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed. the wealth of moria was not in gold  or jewels  but mithril. bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that thorin gave him. yes. i never told him  but its worth was greater than the value of the shire. i have no memory of this place. it's gollum. he's been following us for three days. escaped  or was set loose. now the ring has brought him here. he will never be rid of his need for it. he hates and loves the ring, as he hates and loves himseif. smeagol's life is a sad story. yes, smeagol he was once called. before the ring found him. before it drove him mad. pity? it is pity that stayed bilbo's hand. many that live deserve death. some that die deserve life. can you give it to them, frodo? do not be too eager to deal out death and judgment. even the very wise cannot see all ends. my heart tells me that gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill  before this is over. the pity of bilbo may rule the fate of many. so do all who live to see such times. but that is not for them to decide. all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. there are other forces at work in this world, frodo, besides the will of evil. bilbo was meant to find the ring. in which case, you also were meant to have it. and that is an encouraging thought. it's that way. no. but the air doesn't smell so foul down here. if in doubt, meriadoc, always follow your nose. let me risk a little more light. behold  the great realm and dwarf-city of dwarrowdelf. gimli! “here lies balin  son of fundin  lord of moria.” he is dead, then. it's as i feared. “they have taken the bridge and the second hall. we have barred the gates  but cannot hold them for long. the ground shakes. drums  drums in the deep. we cannot get out. a shadow moves in the dark. we cannot get out. they are coming.” fool of a took! throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity. i think there's more to this hobbit than meets the eye. to the bridge of khazad-dûm! this way! a balrog. a demon of the ancient world. this foe is beyond any of you. run! quickly! lead them on, aragorn. the bridge is near. do as i say! swords are no more use here. over the bridge! fly! you cannot pass! i am a servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of anor. the dark fire will not avail you, flame of udûn! go back to the shadow. you — shall not — pass! fly, you fools! so do all who live to see such times  but that is not for them to decide. all you have to decide  is what to do with the time that is given to you.  you cannot pass! i am a servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of anor. go back to the shadow. the dark fire will not avail you, flame of udun! you shall not pass! fly, you fools. you are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits. they passed this way the day before yesterday. they met someone they did not expect. does that comfort you? i am saruman. or rather, saruman as he should have been. through fire  and water. from the lowest dungeon to the highest peak  i fought with the balrog of morgoth. until at last i threw down my enemy  and smote his ruin upon the mountainside. darkness took me  and i strayed out of thought and time. stars wheeled overhead  and every day was as long as a life age of the earth. but it was not the end. i felt life in me again. i've been sent back  until my task is done. gandalf? yes. that was what they used to call me. gandalf the grey. that was my name. i am gandalf the white. and i come back to you now  at the turn of the tide. one stage of your journey is over. another begins. we must travel to edoras with all speed. yes, and it will not be easily cured. it was more than mere chance that brought merry and pippin to fangorn. a great power has been sleeping here for many long years. the coming of merry and pippin will be like the falling of small stones  that starts an avalanche in the mountains. a thing is about to happen that has not happened since the elder days. the ents are going to wake up  and find that they are strong. so stop your fretting, master dwarf. merry and pippin are quite safe. in fact, they are far safer than you are about to be. shadowfax. he is the lord of all horses  and has been my friend through many dangers. the veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape. sauron will suffer no rival. from the summit of barad-dur, his eye watches ceaselessly. but he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear. doubt ever gnaws at him. the rumor has reached him. the heir of numenor still lives. sauron fears you, aragorn. he fears what you may become. and so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of men. he will use his puppet saruman to destroy rohan. war is coming. rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge  for rohan is weak and ready to fall. the king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of saruman's. his hold over king theoden is now very strong. sauron and saruman are tightening the noose. but for all their cunning  we have one advantage. the ring remains hidden. and that we should seek to destroy it  has not yet entered their darkest dreams. and so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards mordor  in the hands of a hobbit. each day brings it closer to the fires of mount doom. we must trust now in frodo. everything depends upon speed  and the secrecy of his quest. do not regret your decision to leave him. frodo must finish this task alone. did he? did he, indeed? good. yes, very good. edoras and the golden hall of meduseld. there dwells theoden, king of rohan  whose mind is overthrown. saruman's hold over king theoden is now very strong. be careful what you say. do not look for welcome here. you would not part an old man from his walking stick. the courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late  theoden king. be silent. keep your forked tongue behind your teeth. i have not passed through fire and death  to bandy crooked words with a witless worm. theoden  son of thengel  too long have you sat in the shadows. hearken to me! i release you  from the spell. i will draw you, saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound. you did not kill me  you will not kill him. be gone. breathe the free air again, my friend. your fingers would remember their old strength better  if they grasped your sword. theodred's death was not of your making. he was strong in life. his spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers. be thou well. go thou, théodred, go thou. this is but a taste of the terror that saruman will unleash. all the more potent for he is driven now by fear of sauron. ride out and meet him head on. draw him away from your women and children. you must fight. then what is the king's decision? helm's deep. there is no way out of that ravine. theoden is walking into a trap. he thinks he's leading them to safety. what they will get is a massacre. theoden has a strong will, but i fear for him. i fear for the survival of rohan. he will need you before the end, aragorn. the people of rohan will need you. the defenses have to hold. the grey pilgrim. that's what they used to call me. three hundred lives of men i've walked this earth, and now i have no time. with luck, my search will not be in vain. look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. at dawn, look to the east. look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. at dawn  look to the east. theoden king stands alone. sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift. the battle for helm's deep is over. the battle for middle-earth is about to begin. all our hopes now lie with two little hobbits  somewhere in the wilderness.  hobbits. be careful. even in defeat, saruman is dangerous. no. we need him alive. we need him to talk. your treachery has already cost many lives. thousands more are now at risk. but you could save them, saruman. you were deep in the enemy's counsel. no. come down, saruman  and your life will be spared. saruman  your staff is broken. saruman! you were deep in the enemy's counsel. tell us what you know! send word to all our allies  and to every corner of middle-earth that still stands free. the enemy moves against us. we need to know where he will strike. peregrin took! i'll take that, my lad. quickly, now. no word. nothing. do we know that? that frodo is alive. yes. yes, he's alive. fool of a took! look at me. look at me. what did you see? minas tirith? is that what you saw? and what did you tell him? speak! what did you tell him about frodo and the ring? there was no lie in pippin's eyes. a fool  but an honest fool he remains. he told sauron nothing of frodo and the ring. we've been strangely fortunate. pippin saw in the palantir a glimpse of the enemy's plan. sauron moves to strike the city of minas tirith. his defeat at helm's deep showed our enemy one thing. he knows the heir of elendil has come forth. men are not as weak as he supposed. there is courage still, strength enough perhaps to challenge him. sauron fears this. he will not risk the peoples of middle-earth uniting under one banner. he will raze minas tirith to the ground  before he sees a king return to the throne of men. if the beacons of gondor are lit, rohan must be ready for war. no! they will be. you must come to minas tirith by another road. follow the river. look to the black ships. understand this: things are now in motion that cannot be undone. i ride for minas tirith  and i won't be going alone. of all the inquisitive hobbits, peregrin took, you are the worst. hurry! hurry! three days' ride, as the nazgul flies. and you better hope we don't have one of those on our tail. run, shadowfax. show us the meaning of haste. we've just passed into the realm of gondor. minas tirith. city of kings. make way! yes, the white tree of gondor. the tree of the king. lord denethor, however, is not king. he is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne. now listen carefully. lord denethor is boromir's father. to give him news of his beloved son's death would be most unwise. and do not mention frodo or the ring. and say nothing of aragorn either. in fact, it's better if you don't speak at all, peregrin took. hail denethor, son of ecthelion, lord and steward of gondor. i come with tidings in this dark hour, and with counsel. pippin. get up. my lord, there will be a time to grieve for boromir  but it is not now. war is coming. the enemy is on your doorstep. as steward, you are charged  with the defense of this city. where are gondor's armies? you still have friends. you are not alone in this fight. send word to theoden of rohan. light the beacons. authority is not given to you to deny the return of the king, steward. come. all has turned to vain ambition. he would even use his grief as a cloak. a thousand years this city has stood. now, at the whim of a madman, it will fall. and the white tree, the tree of the king  will never bloom again. they guard it because they have hope. a faint and fading hope that one day it will flower. that a king will come and this city will be as it once was  before it fell into decay. the old wisdom borne out of the west was forsaken. kings made tombs more splendid than the houses of the living  and counted the old names of their descent  dearer than the names of their sons. childless lords sat in aged halls, musing on heraldry  or in high, cold towers, asking questions of the stars. and so the people of gondor fell into ruin. the line of kings failed. the white tree withered. the rule of gondor was given over to lesser men. yes, there it lies. this city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow. this is not the weather of the world. this is a device of sauron's making. a broil of fume he sends ahead of his host. the orcs of mordor have no love of daylight  so he covers the face of the sun  to ease their passage along the road to war. when the shadow of mordor reaches this city  it will begin. oh, it's too late for that, peregrin. there's no leaving this city. help must come to us. you're in the service of the steward now. you'll have to do as you're told, peregrin took. ridiculous hobbit. guard of the citadel. thank you. yes. it's the deep breath before the plunge. there never was much hope. just a fool's hope. our enemy is ready. his full strength's gathered. not only orcs, but men as well. legions of haradrim from the south  mercenaries from the coast. all will answer mordor's call. this will be the end of gondor as we know it. here the hammer stroke will fall hardest. if the river is taken, if the garrison at osgiliath falls  the last defense of this city will be gone. sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant  the one who will lead mordor's armies in war. the one they say no living man can kill. the witch king of angmar. you've met him before. he stabbed frodo on weathertop. he is the lord of the nazgul  the greatest of the nine. minas morgul is his lair. we come to it at last. the great battle of our time. the board is set. the pieces are moving. peregrin took, my lad, there is a task now to be done. another opportunity for one of the shire-folk to prove their great worth. you must not fail me. amon din hope is kindled. foreseen and done nothing. faramir? this is not the first halfling to have crossed your path. where? when? and then the pass of cirith ungol. faramir, tell me everything. tell me all you know. courage is the best defense that you have now. faramir! faramir! your father's will has turned to madness. do not throw away your life so rashly. your father loves you, faramir. he will remember it before the end. prepare for battle! hurry, men! to the wall! defend the wall! return to your posts! send these foul beasts into the abyss. hold them back! do not give in to fear. stand to your posts! fight! not at the towers! aim for the trolls! kill the trolls! bring them down! fight them back! peregrin took! go back to the citadel! this is no place for a hobbit. guard of the citadel, indeed. now, back, up the hill. quickly. quick! back to the gate! hurry! steady. steady. you are soldiers of gondor. no matter what comes through that gate, you will stand your ground. volley! the city is breached! fall back! to the second level! get the women and children out! get them out! retreat! fight! fight to the last man! fight for your lives! up! quickly! go back to the abyss. fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your master. stay this madness! so passes denethor, son of ecthelion. end? no, the journey doesn't end here. death is just another path  one that we all must take. the grey rain curtain of this world rolls back  and all turns to silver glass. and then you see it. white shores  and beyond. a far green country  under a swift sunrise. no. no, it isn't. frodo has passed beyond my sight. the darkness is deepening. it's only a matter of time. he has suffered a defeat, yes but  behind the walls of mordor, our enemy is regrouping. because 10,000 orcs now stand between frodo and mount doom. i've sent him to his death. sauron will suspect a trap. he will not take the bait. we do not come to treat with sauron  faithless and accursed. tell your master this: the armies of mordor must disband. he is to depart these lands, never to return. silence. silence! now come the days of the king. may they be blessed. farewell  my brave hobbits. my work is now finished. here at last, on the shores of the sea  comes the end of our fellowship. i will not say, “do not weep”  for not all tears are an evil. it is time, frodo.\""

       "' i think i\\'ll just have another ale. good night. mind who you\\'re sweet-taking. does she? good night, mr. frodo. i haven\\'t been dropping no eaves. honest. i was just cutting the grass under the window there if you follow me. i heard raisedices. nothing important. that is, i heard a good deal about a ring, and a dark lord  and something about the end of the world but  please, mr. gandalf, sir, don\\'t hurt me. don\\'t turn me into anything unnatural. this is it. if i take one more step  it\\'ll be the farthest away from home i\\'ve ever been. they\\'re leaving middle-earth. i don\\'t know why  it makes me sad. everywhere i lie there\\'s a dirty great root sticking into my back. it\\'s not working, mr. frodo. i\\'m never going to be able to sleep out here. mr. frodo? frodo? frodo! i thought i\\'d lost you. it\\'s just something gandalf said. “don\\'t you lose him, samwise gamgee.” and i don\\'t mean to. get off him. come on, frodo. you\\'ve been into farmer maggot\\'s crop! trust a brandybuck and a took! short cut to what? be quiet! anything? get down! frodo! frodo, come on! come on! faster! what do we do now? you got a whole half already! that fellow\\'s done nothing but stare at you since we arrived. let him go! or i\\'ll have you, longshanks. but where is he leading us? did you hear that? rivendell. we\\'re going to see the elves. we saved some for you, mr. frodo. back, you devils! frodo! strider! help him, strider. we\\'re six days from rivendell! he\\'ll never make it! look, frodo. it\\'s mr. bilbo\\'s trolls. mr. frodo? he\\'s going cold. athelas? kingsfoil, aye, it\\'s a weed. she\\'s an elf. what are you doing?! those wraiths are still out there! frodo! bless you, you\\'re awake! we were that worried about you. weren\\'t we, mr. gandalf? now, what have i forgotten? no harm in being prepared. i do. i did. it\\'s just  we did what gandalf wanted, didn\\'t we? we got the ring this far, to rivendell. and i thought  seeing as how you\\'re on the mend, we\\'d be off soon. off home. mr. frodo\\'s not going anywhere without me. what is that? bye-bye, bill. strider! get off him! now there\\'s an eye opener, and no mistake. frodo! i think i\\'m getting the hang of this. frodo! he\\'s alive. mr. frodo? i bet they don\\'t mention his fireworks. there should be a verse about them. the finest rockets ever seen they burst in stars of blue and green or after thunder, silver showers came falling like a rain of flowers oh, that doesn\\'t do them justice by a long road. thank you, my lady. have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers? have some food, mr. frodo. you haven\\'t eaten anything all day. you\\'re not sleeping, neither. don\\'t think i haven\\'t noticed. mr. frodo but you\\'re not. i\\'m here to help you. i promised gandalf that i would. mr. frodo! frodo! frodo, no! frodo! mr. frodo! of course you are. and i\\'m coming with you! i made a promise, mr. frodo. a promise: “don\\'t you leave him, samwise gamgee.” and i don\\'t mean to. i don\\'t mean to. strider will look after them. we may yet, mr. frodo. we may.  what is it, mr. frodo? can you see the bottom? catch it! grab it, mr. frodo! mr. frodo! bogs and rope, and goodness knows what. it\\'s not natural. none of it. nothing. just a bit of seasoning. i thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something. you never know. it\\'s very special, that. it\\'s the best salt in all the shire. who\\'s gonna follow us down here, mr. frodo? it\\'s a shame, really. lady galadriel gave me that. real elvish rope. well, there\\'s nothing for it. it\\'s one of my knots. won\\'t come free in a hurry. mordor. the one place in middle-earth we don\\'t want to see any closer. and it\\'s the one place we\\'re trying to get to. it\\'s just where we can\\'t get. let\\'s face it, mr. frodo, we\\'re lost. i don\\'t think gandalf meant for us to come this way. mr. frodo? it\\'s the ring, isn\\'t it? well, let me see. oh, yes. lovely. lembas bread. and look! more lembas bread. i don\\'t usually hold with foreign food  but this elvish stuff, it\\'s not bad. those rain clouds might. this looks strangely familiar. what is that horrid stink? i warrant there\\'s a nasty bog nearby. can you smell it? quiet, you! it\\'s hopeless. every orc in mordor\\'s going to hear this racket. let\\'s just tie him up and leave him. it\\'s no more than you deserve! i don\\'t believe you! get down! i said, down! he\\'s trying to trick us. if we let him go, he\\'ll throttle us in our sleep. hey! come back now! come back! there! what did i tell you? he\\'s run off, the old villain. so much for his promises. it\\'s a bog. he\\'s led us into a swamp. i hate this place. it\\'s too quiet. there\\'s been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days. well, starve, then. and good riddance! there are dead things! dead faces in the water. frodo! mr. frodo! are you all right? black riders! come on, frodo. come on! i thought they were dead. mr. frodo! it\\'s all right. i\\'m here. oh, save us. my old gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now. that\\'s it, then. we can\\'t get past that. look! the gate. it\\'s opening! i can see a way down. i know, mr. frodo. i doubt even these elvish cloaks will hide us in there. why haven\\'t you spoken of this before? he\\'s up to something. mr. frodo, no. no. hey, stinker, don\\'t go getting too far ahead. what? because. because that\\'s what he is, mr. frodo. there\\'s naught left in him but lies and deceit. it\\'s the ring he wants. it\\'s all he cares about. why? you can\\'t save him, mr. frodo. i do. it\\'s the ring. you can\\'t take your eyes off it. i\\'ve seen you. you\\'re not eating. you barely sleep. it\\'s taken hold of you, mr. frodo. you have to fight it. can\\'t you hear yourself? don\\'t you know who you sound like? you\\'ll make him sick, you will  behaving like that. there\\'s only one way to eat a brace of coneys. what\\'s to ruin? there\\'s hardly any meat on \\'em. waht we need\\'s a few good taters. po-ta-toes. boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew. lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish. even you couldn\\'t say no to that. you\\'re hopeless. mr. frodo? who are they? ready to do what? mr. frodo. look. it\\'s an oliphaunt. no one at home will believe this. wait! we\\'re innocent travelers! spies? now wait just a minute. his gardener. we have to get out of here. you go. go, now. you can do it. use the ring, mr. frodo. just this once. put it on. disappear. mr. frodo  stop it! leave him alone. don\\'t you understand? he\\'s got to destroy it! that\\'s where we\\'re going, into mordor. to the mountain of fire! please. it\\'s such a burden. will you not help him? mr. frodo? hold on, mr. frodo. you\\'ll be all right. do you want to know what happened to boromir? you want to know why your brother died? he tried to take the ring from frodo after swearing an oath to protect him! he tried to kill him! the ring drove your brother mad! mr. frodo? what are you doing? where are you going? it\\'s me. it\\'s your sam. don\\'t you know your sam? i know. it\\'s all wrong. by rights, we shouldn\\'t even be here. but we are. it\\'s like in the great stories, mr. frodo. the ones that really mattered. full of darkness and danger they were. and sometimes you didn\\'t want to know the end  because how could the end be happy? how could the world go back to the way it was  when so much bad had happened? but in the end, it\\'s only a passing thing  this shadow. even darkness must pass. a new day will come. and when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer. those were the stories that stayed with you  that meant something. even if you were too small to understand why. but i think, mr. frodo, i do understand. i know now. folk in those stories  had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn\\'t. they kept going  because they were holding on to something. that there\\'s some good in this world, mr. frodo. and it\\'s worth fighting for. captain faramir  you have shown your quality, sir. the very highest. come on, keep up. mr. frodo didn\\'t mean for them rangers to hurt you. you know that, don\\'t you? he was trying to save you, see? so there\\'s no hard feelings. forgive and forget. very decent of you. very decent, indeed, gollum. i wonder if we\\'ll ever be put into songs or tales. i wonder if people will ever say, \"let\\'s hear about frodo and the ring.\" and they\\'ll say, \"yes! that\\'s one of my favorite stories.\" frodo was really courageous, wasn\\'t he, dad? yes, my boy. the most famousest of hobbits. and that\\'s saying a lot. now, mr. frodo, you shouldn\\'t make fun. i was being serious. samwise the brave. we\\'re not going to wait for you. come on. where is he? where has he gone? hey, gollum! where are you?  haven\\'t you had any sleep, mr. frodo? i\\'ve gone and had too much. must be getting late. not before mr. frodo\\'s had something to eat. here. oh, no, i\\'m not hungry. leastways, not for lembas bread. all right. we don\\'t have that much left. we have to be careful or we\\'re going to run out. you go ahead and eat that, mr. frodo. i\\'ve rationed it. there should be enough. the journey home. you treacherous little toad! i heard it from his own mouth. he means to murder us. you miserable little maggot! i\\'ll stove your head in! call me a liar?

that was just a detour. a short cut. here's a nice one, sam. what was that? that black rider was looking for something. or someone. frodo? right. bucklebury ferry. follow me. run! this way! follow me! run! get the rope, sam! the brandywine bridge. 20 miles. this, my friend, is a pint. how can we know this strider is a friend of gandalf? he's foul enough. don't think he knows about second breakfast, pip. i wouldn't count on it. pippin! what do they eat when they can't get hobbit? my tomato's burst. want a tomato, sam? tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon. they're close. who is she? where are you taking him? oy. we're coming too! you'll have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us. well, that rules you out, pip. you look good, pippin. get him! for the shire! you've got my arm! you've got my arm! what do you suppose that means? aragorn! frodo! pippin. no. gandalf's thinking. what? he's remembered. what do they say about him? how many did you eat? where's frodo? frodo! he's leaving. pippin! run, frodo. go! hey! hey, you! over here! over here! i know it's working! run!  hello, pip. i'm fine. it was just an act. see? i fooled you too. don't worry about me, pip. i think we might have made a mistake leaving the shire, pippin. it's the trees. you remember the old forest, on the borders of buckland? folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall  and come alive. trees that could whisper  talk to each other  even move. as soon as they find out we don't, we're dead. pippin. let's go. pippin! the belt! run! trees. climb a tree. he's gone. a tree-herder. a shepherd of the forest. we're not orcs! we're hobbits! no! you don't understand. we're hobbits! halflings! shire-folk! saruman. is it much further? hello? treebeard? where has he gone? did you hear that? there it is again. something's not right here. not right at all. you just said something treeish. you're taller. you! than me! pippin, everyone knows i'm the tall one. you're the short one. three-foot-eight. you did something. i want some! it's got my leg! why is that? can't say that i have. you, pip? isengard? it's saruman's army. the war has started. what's that? a gathering of what? it's been going for hours. but it's nighttime already. you can't take forever. we're running out of time! yes? and what about saruman? have you come to a decision about him? hasty? our friends are out there. they need our help. they cannot fight this war on their own. how can that be your decision?! but you're part of this world! aren't you?! you must help. please. you must do something. the fires of isengard will spread  and the woods of tuckborough and buckland will burn. and  and all that was once green and good in this world will be gone. there won't be a shire, pippin. are you mad? we'll be caught. where are they going? yes. pippin! hold on! he doesn't look too happy, does he? still, i suppose the view would be quite nice from up there. nothing. the world's back to normal, that's all. good luck trying to find something decent to eat around here. probably only dead rats and moldy bread. saruman's storeroom! it can't be. longbottom leaf. the finest pipe-weed in the south farthing. share it? no. no. dead plant and all that. don't think he'd understand. could be a distant relative. exactly. bar-hrum.  it's good. definitely from the shire. longbottom leaf. green dragon. only, you've never done a hard day's work. welcome, my lords  to isengard! we're under orders from treebeard  who's taken over management of isengard. pippin! thank you! i win! what are you doing?

the white wizard? i had the loveliest dream last night. there was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed. and we smoked all of it. and then  you were sick. i\\'d give anything for a whiff of old toby. no, i didn\\'t. i was just stretching. who? than what? i\\'ve always been taller than you. please, merry. whereas me, i\\'m pushing 3\\'7\". 3\\'8\"! merry, don\\'t! don\\'t drink it! merry! treebeard said, treebeard said you shouldn\\'t have any. he said it could well be dangerous! give me it back. merry! what\\'s happening?! merry! help! why are there so few of you when you have lived so long? are there ent children? oh, i\\'m sorry. how did they die? what do they look like? look. there\\'s smoke to the south. what is it? they must have decided something by now. merry. well, that\\'s good news. maybe treebeard\\'s right. we don\\'t belong here, merry. it\\'s too big for us. what can we do in the end? we\\'ve got the shire. maybe we should go home. wait! stop! stop! turn around. turn around. take us south. yes. exactly. if we go south, we can slip past saruman unnoticed. the closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm. it\\'s the last thing he\\'ll expect. no, we won\\'t. not this time. i\\'m sorry, treebeard. look! the trees! they\\'re moving! yes! not too happy at all, merry. oh, yes. it\\'s a quality establishment. i hear the staff are very good. what are you doing? no, it isn\\'t. i\\'m starving. i don\\'t believe it. it is! it\\'s perfect. one barrel each. wait. do you think we should share it with treebeard? don\\'t be hasty.  i feel like i\\'m back at the green dragon. a mug of ale in my hand. putting my feet up on a settle after a hard day\\'s work. we are sitting on a field of victory  enjoying a few well-earned comforts. the salted pork is particularly good. but you\\'ll never find a beer so brown i just want to look at it. just one more time. gandalf, forgive me. a tree. there was a white tree  in a courtyard of stone. it was dead. the city was burning. i saw  i saw him. i could hear hisice in my head. he asked me my name. i didn\\'t answer. he hurt me. where are we going? i don\\'t know. i can\\'t help it. i\\'m sorry, all right? i won\\'t do it again. and you ? you\\'re coming with me? merry? how far is minas tirith? the last of the longbottom leaf. but but we\\'ll see each other soon. won\\'t we? merry. merry! it\\'s the tree. gandalf. gandalf. boromir died to save us  my kinsman and me. he fell defending us from many foes. i offer you my service, such as it is  in payment of this debt. the mightiest man may be slain by one arrow  and boromir was pierced by many. why are they still guarding it? mordor. a storm is coming. well  minas tirith  very impressive. so where are we off to next? so i imagine this is just a ceremonial position. i mean, they don\\'t actually expect me to do any fighting. do they? there\\'s no more stars. is it time? it\\'s so quiet. i don\\'t want to be in a battle  but waiting on the edge of one i can\\'t escape is even worse. is there any hope, gandalf, for frodo and sam? but we have the white wizard. that\\'s got to count for something. gandalf? you\\'ve seen frodo and sam? what does that mean? what\\'s wrong? what were you thinking, peregrin took? what service can a hobbit offer such a great lord of men? i didn\\'t think they would find any livery that would fit me. this was yours? well  i\\'m taller than you were then. though i\\'m not likely to grow anymore, except sideways. i think you have strength of a different kind. and one day your father will see it. here do i swear fealty and service to gondor  in peace or war  in living or dying  from  from this hour henceforth  until my lord release me  or death take me. well  yes. at least, well enough for my own people. but we have no songs for great halls  and evil times. home is behind the world ahead and there are many paths to tread through shadow to the edge of night until the stars are all alight mist and shadow cloud and shade all shall fade all shall fade he\\'s alive! he needs medicine, my lord. my lord! they\\'d called us out to fight. he\\'s not dead. he\\'s not dead! no! no! no! no! he\\'s not dead! no! no! no! gandalf! where is gandalf? gandalf! gandalf! gandalf! denethor has lost his mind! he\\'s burning faramir alive! gandalf! no! no! i didn\\'t think it would end this way. what, gandalf? see what? well  that isn\\'t so bad. merry. merry! merry! merry. merry, it\\'s me. it\\'s pippin. yes. no, merry. i\\'m going to look after you. where are they?

saruman. riders of rohan  what news from the mark? i am aragorn, son of arathorn. this is gimli, son of gloin, and legolas of the woodland realm. we are friends of rohan and of theoden, your king. we are no spies. we track a party of uruk-hai westward across the plain. they have taken two of our friends captive. they would be small. only children to your eyes. a hobbit lay here. and the other. they crawled. their hands were bound. their bonds were cut. they ran over here. they were followed. tracks lead away from the battle  into fangorn forest. these are strange tracks. gimli! lower your ax. what do you see? do not let him speak. he will put a spell on us. we must be quick. where are they? who are you? show yourself! it cannot be. you fell. gandalf. we hear of trouble in rohan. it goes ill with the king. in one thing you have not changed, dear friend. you still speak in riddles. he's not alone. sam went with him. wait. no, my lord! no, my lord. let him go. enough blood has been spilt on his account. you have 2000 good men riding north as we speak. eomer is loyal to you. his men will return and fight for their king. open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not. he's only doing what he thinks is best for his people. helm's deep has saved them in the past. they will hold. go. fast  quiet now. fast  quiet  quiet  quiet  quiet  a battle is stirring, you heard. what is your name? what is your name? brego. your name is kingly. what troubles you, brego? what did you see? i was raised in rivendell  for a time. turn this fellow free. he's seen enough of war. you have some skill with a blade. what do you fear, my lady? you're a daughter of kings  a shield maiden of rohan. i do not think that would be your fate. it's the beards. thank you. it's good. king theoden has a good memory. he was only a small child at the time. eighty-seven. there are few of us left. the northern kingdom was destroyed long ago. i am asleep. this is a dream. you told me once  this day would come. my path is hidden from me. arwen  but never more than memory. she stays because she still has hope. i shall not return. i do not speak of death in battle. the way is open to you  the way to another life  away from war grief, despair. i am mortal. you are elf-kind. it was a dream, arwen. nothing more. this belongs to you. she is sailing to the undying lands with all that is left of her kin. warg! we're under attack! get them out of here! brego. well done, brego, my friend. gimli, where is the king? thank you. all isengard is emptied. ten thousand strong at least. it is an army bred for a single purpose: to destroy the world of men. they will be here by nightfall. they do not come to destroy rohan's crops or villages. they come to destroy its people  down to the last child. send out riders, my lord. you must call for aid. gondor will answer. we'll place the reserves along the wall. they can support the archers from above the gate. that is an honorable charge. my lady, a time may come for valor without renown. who then will your people look to in the last defense? it is not in my power to command it. farmers, farriers, stable boys. these are no soldiers. they have more hope of defending themselves here than at edoras then i shall die as one of them! give me your sword. what is your name? this is a good sword. haleth, son of hama  there is always hope. there is nothing to forgive, legolas. well met, haldir! you are most welcome. o, children of eru  show them no mercy… for you shall receive none! hold! prepare to fire! release arrows! ladders! swords! swords! causeway! bring him down, legolas! kill him! kill him! gimli! hurl the arrows! charge! to the keep! pull back! haldir! pull back! haldir! how long do you need? gimli! it's a long way. what? not a word. hurry! inside. get them inside! you said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it. they still defend it. they have died defending it. is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves? is there no other way? send word for the women and children to make for the mountain pass. and barricade the entrance! ride out with me. ride out and meet them. for rohan. for your people. gandalf.  show yourself. pippin! no news of frodo? we have time. every day, frodo moves closer to mordor. what does your heart tell you? not yet dawn. night changes many thoughts. sleep, eowyn. sleep  while you can. i will go. they must be warned. merry! one thing i have learned about hobbits: they're a most hardy folk. the beacons of minas tirith! the beacons are lit! gondor calls for aid. will you ride with us? six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of mordor. every hour lost hastens gondor's defeat. we have till dawn, then we must ride. my lord elrond. it will not be our end, but his. there are none. murderers  traitors. you would call upon them to fight? they believe in nothing. they answer to no one. sauron will not have forgotten the sword of elendil. the blade that was broken shall return to minas tirith. i keep none for myself. eowyn  why have you come? it is but a shadow and a thought that you love. i cannot give you what you seek. i have wished you joy since first i saw you. not this time. this time you must stay, gimli. brego! i do not fear death. do not look down. one who will have your allegiance. you will suffer me. i summon you to fulfill your oath. it has been remade. fight for us  and regain your honor. what say you? what say you? i am isildur's heir. fight for me  and i will hold your oaths fulfilled. what say you? you have my word! fight, and i will release you from this living death! what say you?! out! legolas! run! you may go no further. you will not enter gondor. legolas, fire a warning shot past the bosun's ear. this army. legolas! i hold your oath fulfilled. go. be at peace. if sauron had the ring, we would know it. no. there is still hope for frodo. he needs time and safe passage across the plains of gorgoroth. we can give him that. draw out sauron's armies. empty his lands. then we gather our full strength and march on the black gate. not for ourselves. but we can give frodo his chance if we keep sauron's eye fixed upon us. keep him blind to all else that moves. oh, i think he will. long have you hunted me. long have i eluded you. no more. behold the sword of elendil. let the lord of the black land come forth! let justice be done upon him! i do not believe it. i will not. pull back. pull back! hold your ground! hold your ground. sons of gondor, of rohan, my brothers! i see in your eyes  the same fear that would take the heart of me. a day may come when the courage of men fails  when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship. but it is not this day. an hour of wolves and shattered shields  when the age of men comes crashing down. but it is not this day. this day we fight! by all that you hold dear on this good earth  i bid you stand, men of the west! for frodo. this day does not belong to one man  but to all. let us together rebuild this world  that we may share in the days of peace. out of the great sea  to middle-earth i am come. in this place will i abide  and my heirs  unto the ending of the world. thank you. my friends  you bow to no one.\""

       "\" then what are we waiting for? and i suppose you think you are the one to do it! i will be dead before i see the ring in the hands of an elf! never trust an elf! and my ax. if anyone was to ask for my opinion, which i note they're not  i'd say we were taking the long way 'round. gandalf. we could pass through the mines of moria. my cousin balin would give us a royal welcome. nothing. it's just a wisp of cloud. we cannot pass over a mountain. let us go under it. let us go through the mines of moria. the walls  of moria. dwarf doors are invisible when closed. soon, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the dwarves. roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone! this, my friend, is the home of my cousin balin. and they call it a mine. a mine! no  no! oh, that was a kingly gift. no! oh, no. no. let them come! there is one dwarf yet in moria who still draws breath. mithril. you are full of surprises, master baggins. nobody tosses a dwarf. not the beard! stay close, young hobbits! they say that a great sorceress lives in these woods. an elf-witch  of terrible power. all who look upon her  fall under her spell. and are never seen again. well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily. i have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox. so much for the legendary courtesy of the elves! speak words we can all understand! and you know what this dwarf says to that? i spit upon your grave! nothing. except to look upon the lady of the galadhrim one last time  for she is more fair than all the jewels beneath the earth. actually  there was one thing. no, no, i couidn't. it's quite impossible. stupid to ask. i have taken my worst wound at this parting  having looked my last upon that which is fairest. henceforth i will call nothing fair unless it be her gift to me. i asked her for one hair from her golden head. she gave me three. oh, yes? just a simple matter of finding our way through emyn muil  an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks. and after that, it gets even better. festering, stinking marshland as far as the eye can see. recover my  recover strength? pay no heed to that, young hobbit. then it has all been in vain. the fellowship has failed. yes!  three days and nights pursuit. no food. no rest. and no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell. i'm wasted on cross-country. we dwarves are natural sprinters. very dangerous over short distances. keep breathing. that's the key. breathe. give me your name, horse-master, and i shall give you mine. but there were two hobbits. did you see two hobbits with them? dead? it's one of their wee belts. we failed them. fangorn? what madness drove them in there? orc blood. the air is so close in here. talking trees. what do trees have to talk about? except the consistency of squirrel droppings. gandalf. edoras? that is no short distance! then we have run all this way for nothing? are we to leave those poor hobbits here  in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested ? i mean, charming  quite charming forest. strong?! oh, that's good. this new gandalf's more grumpy than the old one. you'll find more cheer in a graveyard. i would stay still if i were you. they flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight. who will defend them if not their king? it's true, you don't see many dwarf women. and in fact, they are so alike inice and appearance  that they're often mistaken for dwarf men. this, in turn, has given rise to the belief  that there are no dwarf women  and that dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground  which is, of course, ridiculous. it's all right. it's all right. nobody panic. that was deliberate. it was deliberate. no, i couldn't i really couldn't. come on. get me up here. i'm a rider. come on! forward. i mean, charge forward. that's it! go on! bring your pretty face to my ax. that one counts as mine! stinking creature. aragorn? tell me what happened and i will ease your passing. my lady. he fell. where is he? where is he? get out of the way! i'm gonna kill him! you are the luckiest, the canniest  and the most reckless man i ever knew. bless you, laddie. this is no rabble of mindless orcs. these are uruk-hai. their armor is thick and their shields broad. most have seen too many winters. let him go, lad. let him be. we had time, i'd get this adjusted. it's a little tight across the chest. you could have picked a better spot. well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night. let's hope they last the night. what's happening out there? did they hit anything? send them to me! come on! good! legolas! two already! i'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me! seventeen! eighteen! nineteen! twenty! aragorn! what are you doing? what are you stopping for? come on. we can take 'em. toss me. i cannot jump the distance! you'll have to toss me! don't tell the elf. the sun is rising. yes! forty-two? oh, that's not bad for a pointy-eared elvish princeling. i myself am sitting pretty on 43. he was already dead. he was twitching  because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!  you young rascals! a merry hunt you've led us on  and now we find you feasting and and smoking! salted pork? well, let's just have his head and be done with it. i've heard enough! shoot him. stick an arrow in his gob. and no regurgitation. last one standing wins. here, here. it's the dwarves that go swimming with little, hairy women. what did i say? he can't hold his liquor. horse-men. i wish i could muster a legion of dwarves, fully armed and filthy. that road there  where does that lead? aragorn. let's find some food. just where do you think you're off to? you might as well accept it. we're going with you, laddie. what kind of army would linger in such a place? the very warmth of my blood seems stolen away. well, this is a thing unheard-of. an elf will go underground where a dwarf dare not? oh. oh, i'd never hear the end of it. what is it? what do you see? where? the dead? summoned? i knew that. very good. very good! legolas! you waste your time, aragorn. they had no honor in life, they have none now in death. stand, you traitors! mind your aim. that's it. right. we warned you. prepare to be boarded. there's plenty for the both of us. may the best dwarf win. 17! that still only counts as one! come on, then. come on! bad idea. very handy in a tight spot, these lads, despite the fact they're dead. let him stay there. let him rot! why should we care? how? certainty of death  small chance of success  what are we waiting for? i guess that concludes negotiations. never thought i'd die fighting side by side with an elf. aye. i could do that.\""

where is my son? simbelmyn. ever has it grown on the tombs of my forbearers. now it shall cover the grave of my son. alas that these evil days should be mine. the young perish and the old linger. that i should live  to see the last days of my house. no parent should have to bury their child. they will be 300 leagues from here by now. eomer cannot help us. i know what it is you want of me  but i will not bring further death to my people. i will not risk open war. when last i looked  theoden, not aragorn, was king of rohan. i am ready, gamling. bring my horse. this is not a defeat. we will return. we will return. i haven't seen my niece smile for a long time. she was a girl when they brought her father back dead. cut down by orcs. she watched her mother succumb to grief. then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear. doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father. what is it? what do you see? all riders to the head of the column. you must lead the people to helm's deep, and make haste. no! you must do this, for me. follow me! get the wounded on horses. the wolves of isengard will return. leave the dead. come. our people are safe. we have paid for it with many lives. draw all our forces behind the wall. bar the gate. and set a watch on the surround. get them into the caves. saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here. a great host, you say? how many? ten thousand? let them come! i want every man and strong lad able to bear arms  to be ready for battle by nightfall. we will cover the causeway and the gate from above. no army has ever breached the deeping wall  or set foot inside the hornburg! i have fought many wars, master dwarf. i know how to defend my own keep. they will break upon this fortress like water on rock. saruman's hordes will pillage and burn. we've seen it before. crops can be resown  homes rebuilt. within these walls  we will outlast them. what would you have me do? look at my men. their courage hangs by a thread. if this is to be our end, then i would have them make such an end  as to be worthy of remembrance. and who will come? elves? dwarves? we are not so lucky in our friends as you. the old alliances are dead. gondor?! where was gondor when the westfold fell?! where was gondor when our enemies closed in around us?! where was gon ? no, my lord aragorn  we are alone. get the women and children into the caves. there is no time. war is upon us. who am i, gamling? and do you trust your king? to whatever end. where is the horse and the rider? where is the horn that was blowing? they have passed like rain on the mountains. like wind in the meadow. the days have gone down in the west  behind the hills  into shadow. how did it come to this? how is this possible? so it begins. give them alley. is this it? is this is all you can conjure, saruman? brace the gate! hold them! stand firm! aragorn! fall back to the keep! get your men out of there! to the gate. draw your swords! hold them!  as long as you can give me. timbers! brace the gate! shore up the door! higher! hold fast the gate! gimli! aragorn! get out of there! pull everybody back. pull them back. the fortress is taken. it is over. so much death. what can men do against such reckless hate? for death and glory. yes. yes. the horn of helm hammerhand  shall sound in the deep  one last time. let this be the hour when we draw swords together. fell deeds, awake. now for wrath  now for ruin and a red dawn. forth eorlingas! eomer. victory! we have victory!  we shall have peace. we shall have peace  when you answer for the burning of the westfold  and the children that lie dead there! we shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers  whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead  against the gates of the hornburg, are avenged! when you hang from a gibbet for the sport of your own crows  we shall have peace. grima, you need not follow him. you were not always as you are now. you were once a man of rohan. come down. grima  come down. be free of him. tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country. hail the victorious dead. i am happy for you. he is an honorable man. it was not theoden of rohan who led our people to victory. ah, don't listen to me. you are young. and tonight is for you. tell me  why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours? what do we owe gondor? and rohan will answer. muster the rohirrim. assemble the army at dunharrow. as many men as can be found. you have two days. on the third, we ride for gondor and war. gamling. make haste across the riddermark. summon every able-bodied man to dunharrow. and gladly i accept it. you shall be meriadoc, esquire of rohan. so it is before the walls of minas tirith  the doom of our time will be decided. grimbold, how many? where are the riders from snowborn? six thousand spears. less than half of what i'd hoped for. more will come. i take my leave. he leaves because he must. no  we cannot. but we will meet them in battle nonetheless. i have left instruction. the people are to follow your rule in my stead. take up my seat in the golden hall. long may you defend edoras  if the battle goes ill. duty? no. i would have you smile again  not grieve for those whose time has come. you shall live to see these days renewed  and no more despair. we must ride light and swift. it is a long road ahead. and man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight. little hobbits do not belong in war, master meriadoc. it is a three-day gallop to minas tirith. and none of my riders can bear you as a burden. i will say no more. ride! ride now to gondor! time is against us. make ready! make haste. we ride through the night. eomer, take your eored down the left flank. gamling, follow the king's banner down the center. grimbold, take your company right after you pass the wall. forth, and fear no darkness! arise, arise, riders of theoden! spears shall be shaken shields shall be splintered  a sword-day, a red day  ere the sun rises! ride now! ride now! ride! ride for ruin  and the world's ending! death! death! death! forth eorlingas! charge! make safe the city! re-form the line! re-form the line! sound the charge! take them head-on! charge! bring it down! bring it down! bring it down! rally to me! to me! i know your face  eowyn. my eyes darken. you already did. eowyn  my body is broken. you have to let me go. i go to my fathers  in whose mighty company  i shall not now feel ashamed. eowyn.\""

so the ring of power has been found. yet you did not have the wit to see it. your love of the halfling's leaf has clearly slowed your mind. time? what time do you think we have? sauron has regained much of his former strength. he cannot yet take physical form  but his spirit has lost none of its potency. concealed within his fortress, the lord of mordor sees all. his gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh. you know of what i speak, gandalf. a great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame. he is gathering all evil to him. very soon, he'll have summoned an army  great enough for an assault upon middle-earth. i have seen it. why? why should we fear to use it? the hour is later than you think. sauron's forces are already moving. the nine have left minas morgul. they crossed the river isen on midsummer's eve  disguised as riders in black. they will find the ring. and kill the one who carries it. you did not seriously think that a hobbit could contend with the will of sauron? there are none who can. against the power of mordor  there can be no victory. we must join with him, gandalf. we must join with sauron. it would be wise, my friend. i gave you the chance of  aiding me willingly  but you have elected the way of pain! the power of isengard is at your command  sauron, lord of the earth. we have work to do. rip them all down. one ill turn deserves another. it is over. embrace the power of the ring  or embrace your own destruction! so you have chosen death. so, gandalf, you try to lead them over caradhras. and if that fails, where then will you go? if the mountain defeats you  will you risk a more dangerous road? wake up cruel redhorn! may your horn be bloodstained! wake up cruel redhorn! may your bloodstained horn  fall upon the enemy-heads! moria. you fear to go into those mines. the dwarves delved too greedily and too deep. you know what they awoke in the darkness of khazad-dûm: shadow and flame. do you know how the orcs first came into being? they were elves once. taken by the dark powers  tortured and mutilated. a ruined and terrible form of life. and now  perfected. my fighting uruk-hai  whom do you serve? hunt them down. do not stop until, they are found. you do not know pain. you do not know fear. you will taste man-flesh! one of the halflings carries something of great value. bring them to me alive and unspoiled. kill the others.  the world is changing. who now has the strength to stand against the armies of isengard  and mordor? to stand against the might of sauron and saruman  and the union of the two towers? together, my lord sauron  we shall rule this middle-earth. the old world will burn in the fires of industry. the forests will fall. a new order will rise. we will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear  and the iron fists of the orc. i want them armed and ready to march within two weeks! build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day. the forest of fangorn lies on our doorstep. burn it. swear it. the horse-men took your lands. they drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks. take back the lands they stole from you. burn every village! we have only to remove those who oppose us. it will begin in rohan. too long have these peasants stood against you. but no more. rohan, my lord  is ready to fall. rohan is mine. gandalf the white. gandalf the fool! does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety? you stink of horse. the man  was he from gondor? the ring of barahir. so gandalf greyhame thinks he has found isildur's heir. the lost king of gondor. he is a fool. the line was broken years ago. it matters not. the world of men shall fall. it will begin at edoras. send out your warg-riders. if the wall is breached, helm's deep will fall. tens of thousands. a new power is rising. its victory is at hand. this night  the land will be stained with the blood of rohan! march to helm's deep! leave none alive! to war! there will be no dawn for men.  you have fought many wars and slain many men, theoden king  and made peace afterwards. can we not take counsel together as we once did, my old friend? can we not have peace, you and i? gibbets and crows? dotard! what do you want, gandalf greyhame? let me guess. the key of orthanc. or perhaps the keys of barad-dur itself  along with the crowns of the seven kings and the rods of the five wizards! so you have come here for information. i have some for you. something festers in the heart of middle-earth. something that you have failed to see. but the great eye has seen it. even now he presses his advantage. his attack will come soon. you're all going to die. but you know this, don't you, gandalf? you cannot think that this ranger will ever sit upon the throne of gondor. this exile, crept from the shadows, will never be crowned king. gandalf does not hesitate to sacrifice those closest to him  those he professes to love. tell me, what words of comfort did you give the halfling  before you sent him to his doom? the path that you have set him on can only lead to death. save your pity and your mercy. i have no use for it! a man of rohan? what is the house of rohan  but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek  and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs? the victory at helm's deep does not belong to you, theoden horse-master. you are a lesser son of greater sires. free? he will never be free. get down, cur! you withdraw your guard, and i will tell you where your doom will be decided. i will not be held prisoner here.\""

       "' the world is changed. i feel it in the water. i feel it in the earth. i smell it in the air. much that once was  is lost. for none now live who remember it. it began with the forging of the great rings. three were given to the elves: immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. seven to the dwarf-lords: great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. and nine  nine rings were gifted to the race of men  who, above all else, desire power. for within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race. but they were all of them deceived. for another ring was made. in the land of mordor, in the fires of mount doom  the dark lord sauron forged in secret a master ring  to control all others. and into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice  and his will to dominate all life. one ring to rule them all. one by one  the free lands of middle-earth fell to the power of the ring. but there were some who resisted. a last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of mordor. and on the slopes of mount doom, they fought for the freedom of middle-earth. hold positions! fire the arrows! victory was near. but the power of the ring  could not be undone. it was in this moment  when all hope had faded  that isildur, son of the king, took up his father\\'s sword. sauron, the enemy of the free peoples of middle-earth, was defeated. the ring passed to isildur  who had this one chance to destroy evil forever. but the hearts of men  are easily corrupted. and the ring of power has a will of its own. it betrayed isildur  to his death. and some things that should not have been forgotten  were lost. history became legend  legend became myth. and for two and a half thousand years  the ring passed out of all knowledge. until, when chance came  it ensnared a new bearer. my precious. the ring came to the creature gollum  who took it deep into the tunnels of the misty mountains. and there it consumed him. it came to me. my own. my love. my own. my precious. the ring brought to gollum unnatural long life. for 500 years it poisoned his mind. and in the gloom of gollum\\'s cave, it waited. darkness crept back into the forests of the world. rumor grew of a shadow in the east  whispers of a nameless fear. and the ring of power perceived  its time had now come. it abandoned gollum. but something happened then the ring did not intend. it was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable. what\\'s this? a hobbit. bilbo baggins of the shire. a ring. lost! my precious is lost! for the time will soon come  when hobbits will shape the fortunes of all. the 22nd day of september  in the year 1400  by shire-reckoning. bag end, bagshot row. hobbiton, westfarthing  the shire  middle-earth. the third age of this world. there and back again. a hobbit\\'s tale. by bilbo baggins. now  where to begin? ah, yes  “concerning  hobbits.” hobbits have been living and farming in the four farthings of the shire  for many hundreds of years  quite content to ignore and be ignored  by the world of the big folk. middle-earth being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count  hobbits must seem of little importance  being neither renowned as great warriors  nor counted among the very wise. frodo! someone at the door. in fact, it has been remarked by some  that hobbits\\' only real passion is for food. a rather unfair observation  as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales  and the smoking of pipe-weed. but where our hearts truly lie  is in peace and quiet  and good, tilled earth. for all hobbits share a love of things that grow. and yes, no doubt to others our ways seem quaint. but today of all days. it is brought home to me  it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life. frodo, the door! sticklebacks. where is that boy? frodo! down from the door where it began and i must follow if i can the road goes ever on and on down from the door where it began now far ahead the road has gone and i must follow if i can you\\'re late. a wizard is never late, frodo baggins. nor is he early. he arrives precisely when he means to. it\\'s wonderful to see you, gandalf! you didn\\'t think i\\'d miss your uncle bilbo\\'s birthday? so how is the old rascal? i hear it\\'s going to be a party of special magnificence. you know bilbo. he\\'s got the whole piece in an uproar. well, that should please him. half the shire\\'s been invited. and the rest of them are turning up anyway. and so life in the shire goes on  very much as it has this past age  ..full of its own comings and goings, with change coming slowly. if it comes at all. for things are made to endure in the shire  passing from one generation to the next. there\\'s always been a baggins living here under the hill  in bag end. and there always will be. to tell you the truth, bilbo\\'s been a bit odd lateiy. i mean, more than usual. he\\'s taken to locking himself in his study. he spends hours and hours poring over old maps when he thinks i\\'m not looking. where\\'s it gone? he\\'s up to something. all right, then. keep your secrets. what? but i know you have something to do with it. good gracious me. before you came along, we bagginses were very well thought of. indeed. never had any adventures or did anything unexpected. if you\\'re referring to the incident with the dragon. i was barely involved. all i did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door. whatever you did, you\\'ve been officially labeled a disturber of the peace. oh, really? gandalf! gandalf! fireworks, gandalf! gandalf! fireworks, gandalf! gandalf? i\\'m glad you\\'re back. so am i, dear boy. so am i. whoa, whoa. no, thank you! we don\\'t want any more visitors, well-wishers or distant relations! and what about very old friends? gandalf? bilbo baggins. my dear gandalf! good to see you. 111 years old! who would believe it? you haven\\'t aged a day. come on, come in! welcome, welcome. oh, here we are. tea or maybe something a littie stronger? i\\'ve got a few bottles of the old winyard left. 1296. very good year. almost as old as i am. it was laid down by my father. what say we open one, eh? just tea, thank you. i was expecting you sometime last week. not that it matters. you come and go as you please. always have and always will. you caught me a bit unprepared i\\'m afraid. we\\'ve only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle  there\\'s some cheese here. no, that won\\'t do. we\\'ve got raspberry jam, an apple tart  but not much for afters. oh, no, we\\'re all right. i\\'ve just found some sponge cake. i could make you some eggs if you\\'d li  just tea, thank you. oh, right. you don\\'t mind if i eat, do you? no, not at all. bilbo! bilbo baggins! i\\'m not at home! it\\'s the sackville-bagginses. i know you\\'re in there! they\\'re after the house. they\\'ve never forgiven me for living this long. i\\'ve got to get away from these confounded relatives, hanging on the bell all day  never giving me a moment\\'s peace. i want to see mountains again. mountains, gandalf! and then find somewhere quiet where i can finish my book. oh, tea. so you mean to go through with your plan? yes, yes. it\\'s all in hand. all the arrangements are made. oh, thank you. frodo suspects something. of course he does. he\\'s a baggins  not some blockheaded bracegirdle from hardbottle. you will tell him, won\\'t you? yes, yes. he\\'s very fond of you. i know. he\\'d probably come with me if i asked him. i think in his heart, frodo\\'s still in love with the shire. the woods, the fields. little rivers. i am old, gandalf. i know i don\\'t look it, but i\\'m beginning to feel it in my heart. i feel thin. sort of stretched  like butter scraped over too much bread. i need a holiday. a very long holiday. and i don\\'t expect i shall return. in fact, i mean not to. old toby. the finest weed in the southfarthing. gandalf, my old friend  this will be a night to remember. hello, hello. fatty bolger. lovely to see you. welcome, welcome. go on, sam. ask rosie for a dance. i think i\\'ll just have another ale. oh, no, you don\\'t. go on! so there i was  at the mercy of three monstrous trolls. and they were all arguing amongst themselves  about how they were going to cook us. whether it be turned on a spit, or whether they should sit on us one by one, squash us into jelly. they spent so much time arguing the whithertos and the whyfors  that the sun\\'s first light crept over the top of the trees  and turned them all to stone! quickly. whoa up they go! no no, the big one — big one mrs. bracegirdle, how nice to see you. welcome, welcome. are all these children yours? good gracious, you have been productive. bilbo? sackville-bagginses! quickly, hide! thank you, my boy. you\\'re a good lad, frodo. i\\'m very selfish, you know. yes, i am. very selfish. i don\\'t know why i took you in after your mother and father died  but it wasn\\'t out of charity. i think it was because  of all my numerous relations  you were the one baggins that showed real spirit. bilbo, have you been at the gaffer\\'s home brew? no. well, yes, but that\\'s not the point. the point is, frodo  you\\'ll be all right. done! you\\'re supposed to stick it in the ground. it is in the ground. outside! this was your idea. bilbo. bilbo, watch out for the dragon! nonsense. there hasn\\'t been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years. that was good. let\\'s get another one. meriadoc brandybuck and peregrin took. i might\\'ve known. speech, bilbo! speech! speech! my dear bagginses and boffins  tooks and brandybucks  grubbs, chubbs  hornblowers  bolgers  bracegirdles  and proudfoots. proudfeet! today is my 111th birthday! happy birthday! but alas, eleventh-one years is far too short a time to live among  such excellent and admirable hobbits. i don\\'t know half of you half as well as i should like  and i like less than half of you half as well as you deserve. i, uh - i have things to do. i\\'ve put this off for far too long. i regret to announce this is the end! i\\'m going now. i bid you all a very fond farewell. goodbye. i suppose you think that was terribly clever. come on, gandalf. did you see their faces? there are many magic rings in this world, bilbo baggins  and none of them should be used lightly. it was just a bit of fun. oh, you\\'re probably right, as usual. you will keep an eye on frodo, won\\'t you? two eyes. as often as i can spare them. i\\'m leaving everything to him. what about this ring of yours? is that staying too? yes, yes. it\\'s in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece. no. wait, it is  here in my pocket. isn\\'t that--? isn\\'t that odd, now? yet, after all, why not? why shouldn\\'t i keep it? i think you should leave the ring behind, bilbo. is that so hard? well, no. and yes. now it comes to it, i don\\'t feel l ike parting with it. it\\'s mine. i found it! it came to me! there\\'s no need to get angry. well, if i\\'m angry, it\\'s your fault! it\\'s mine. my own. my precious. precious? it\\'s been called that before, but not by you. what business is it of yours what i do with my own things? i think you\\'ve had that ring quite long enough. you want it for yourself! bilbo baggins! do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks. i am not trying to rob you. i\\'m trying to help you. all your long years, we\\'ve been friends. trust me as you once did. let it go. you\\'re right, gandalf. the ring must go to frodo. it\\'s late. the road is long. yes, it is time. bilbo. hm? the ring is still in your pocket. ah. yes. i\\'ve thought up an ending for my book: “and he lived happily ever after to the end of his days.” and i\\'m sure you will, my dear friend. goodbye, gandalf. goodbye, dear bilbo. the road goes ever on and on  until our next meeting. it\\'s mine. my own. my precious. riddles in the dark. bilbo! bilbo! my precious. precious. he\\'s gone, hasn\\'t he? he talked for so long about leaving  i didn\\'t think he\\'d really do it. gandalf? bilbo\\'s ring. he\\'s gone to stay with the elves. he\\'s left you bag end. along with all his possessions. the ring is yours now. put it somewhere out of sight. where are you going? there are some things that i must see to. what things? questions. questions that need answering. you\\'ve only just arrived. i don\\'t understand. neither do i. keep it secret. keep it safe. shire! baggins! “the year 3434 of the second age. here follows the account of isildur, high king of gondor  and the finding of the ring of power.” “it has come to me. the one ring. it shall be an heirloom of my kingdom. all those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate  for i will risk no hurt to the ring. it is precious to me  though i buy it with great pain. the markings upon the band begin to fade. the writing, which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared. a secret now that only fire can tell.” shire  baggins. there\\'s no bagginses around here. they\\'re all up in hobbiton. that way. “hey ho to the dock i go to heal my heart and drown my woe rain may fall and wind may blow but there still be  many miles to go sweet is the sound of the pouring rain and the stream that falls from hill to plain better than rain or rippling brook is a mug of beer inside this took!” there\\'s been some strange folk crossing the shire. dwarves and others of a less than savory nature. war is brewing. the mountains are fair teeming with goblins. far-off tales and children\\'s stories, that\\'s all that is. you\\'re beginning to sound like that old bilbo baggins. cracked, he was. young mr. frodo here, he\\'s cracking. and proud of it. cheers, gaffer. aye. cheers. well it\\'s none of our concern what goes on beyond our borders. keep your nose out of trouble, and no trouble\\'ll come to you. good night, lads. good night. good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale. mind who you\\'re sweet-taking. don\\'t worry, sam. rosie knows an idiot when she sees one. does she? good night, sam. good night, mr. frodo. is it secret? is it safe? what are you doing? hold out your hand, frodo. it\\'s quite cool. what can you see? can you see anything? nothing. there\\'s nothing. wait. there are markings. it\\'s some form of elvish. i can\\'t read it. there are few who can. the language is that of mordor, which i will not utter here. mordor! in the common tongue, it says: “one ring to rule them all  one ring to find them  one ring to bring them all  and in the darkness bind them.” this is the one ring  forged by the dark lord sauron in the fires of mount doom. taken by isiidur from the hand of sauron himself. bilbo found it. in gollum\\'s cave. yes. for 60 years, the ring lay quiet in bilbo\\'s keeping  prolonging his life, delaying old age. but no longer, frodo. evil is stirring in mordor. the ring has awoken. it\\'s heard its master\\'s call. but he was destroyed. sauron was destroyed. no, frodo. the spirit of sauron endured. his life force is bound to the ring, and the ring survived. sauron has returned. his orcs have multiplied. his fortress at barad-dã»r is rebuilt in the land of mordor. sauron needs only this ring to cover all the lands in a second darkness. he is seeking it. seeking it — all his thought is bent on it. for the ring yearns above all else  to return to the hand of its master. they are one  the ring and the dark lord. frodo  he must never find it. all right. we put it away. we keep it hidden. we never speak of it again. no one knows it\\'s here, do they? do they, gandalf? there is one other who knew that bilbo had the ring. i looked everywhere for the creature gollum. but the enemy found him first. i don\\'t know how long they tortured him. but amidst the endless screams and inane babble, they discerned two words: shire! baggins! shire. baggins. but that would lead them here! who goes there? take it, gandalf! take it! no, frodo. you must take it! you cannot offer me this ring! i\\'m giving it to you! don\\'t tempt me, frodo! i dare not take it. not even to keep it safe. understand, frodo  i would use this ring from a desire to do good. but through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine. but it cannot stay in the shire! no no, it can\\'t. what must i do? you must leave. and leave quickly. where? where do i go? get out of the shire. make for the village of bree. bree. what about you? i\\'ll be waiting for you  at the inn of the prancing pony. and the ring will be safe there? i don\\'t know, frodo. i don\\'t have any answers. i must see the head of my order. he is both wise and powerful. trust me, frodo. he\\'ll know what to do. you\\'ll have to leave the name of baggins behind you. that name is not safe outside the shire. travel only by day. and stay off the road. i can cut across country easily enough. my dear frodo. hobbits really are amazing creatures. you can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month. and yet, after a hundred years  they can still surprise you. get down. confound it all, samwise gamgee! have you been eavesdropping? i haven\\'t been dropping no eaves. honest. i was just cutting the grass under the window there if you follow me. a little late for trimming the verge, don\\'t you think? i heard raisedices. what did you hear? speak! nothing important. that is, i heard a good deal about a ring, and a dark lord  and something about the end of the world but  please, mr. gandalf, sir, don\\'t hurt me. don\\'t turn me into anything unnatural. no? perhaps not. i\\'ve thought of a better use for you. come along, samwise. keep up. be careful, both of you. the enemy has many spies in his service: birds, beasts. is it safe? never put it on  for the agents of the dark lord will be drawn to its power. always remember, frodo  the ring is trying to get back to its master. it wants to be found. this is it. this is what? if i take one more step  it\\'ll be the farthest away from home i\\'ve ever been. come on, sam. remember what bilbo used to say: “it\\'s a dangerous business, frodo.” “going out your door. you step onto the road, and if you don\\'t keep your feet  there\\'s no knowing where you might be swept off to.” sam. wood-elves. they\\'re going to the harbor beyond the white towers. to the grey havens. they\\'re leaving middle-earth. never to return. i don\\'t know why  it makes me sad. everywhere i lie there\\'s a dirty great root sticking into my back. just shut your eyes  and imagine you\\'re back in your own bed  with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow. it\\'s not working, mr. frodo. i\\'m never going to be able to sleep out here. me neither, sam. smoke rises from the mountain of doom. the hour grows late. and gandalf the grey rides to isengard  seeking my counsel. for that is why you have come, is it not? my old friend. saruman. you are sure of this? beyond any doubt. so the ring of power has been found. all these long years, it was in the shire. under my very nose. yet you did not have the wit to see it. your love of the halfling\\'s leaf has clearly slowed your mind. but we still have time. time enough to counter sauron if we act quickly. time? what time do you think we have? sauron has regained much of his former strength. he cannot yet take physical form  but his spirit has lost none of its potency. concealed within his fortress, the lord of mordor sees all. his gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh. you know of what i speak, gandalf. a great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame. the eye of sauron. he is gathering all evil to him. very soon, he\\'ll have summoned an army  great enough for an assault upon middle-earth. you know this? how? i have seen it. a palantir is a dangerous tool, saruman. why? why should we fear to use it? they are not all accounted for, the lost seeing-stones. we do not know who else may be watching. the hour is later than you think. sauron\\'s forces are already moving. the nine have left minas morgul. the nine? they crossed the river isen on midsummer\\'s eve  disguised as riders in black. they\\'ve reached the shire? they will find the ring. and kill the one who carries it. frodo! you did not seriously think that a hobbit could contend with the will of sauron? there are none who can. against the power of mordor  there can be no victory. we must join with him, gandalf. we must join with sauron. it would be wise, my friend. tell me  friend  when did saruman the wise abandon reason for madness? i gave you the chance of  aiding me willingly  but you have elected the way of pain! mr. frodo? frodo? frodo! i thought i\\'d lost you. what are you taking about? it\\'s just something gandalf said. what did he say? “don\\'t you lose him, samwise gamgee.” and i don\\'t mean to. sam, we\\'re still in the shire. what could possibly happen? frodo. merry, it\\'s frodo baggins. hello, frodo. get off him. come on, frodo. what\\'s the meaning of this? you\\'ve been into farmer maggot\\'s crop! you get back here! get out of my field! you\\'ll know the devil if i catch up with you! i don\\'t know why he\\'s so upset. it\\'s only a couple of carrots. and some cabbages. and those three bags of potatoes that we lifted last week. and then the mushrooms the week before. yes, pippin. my point is  he\\'s clearly overreacting. run! oh, that was close. i think i\\'ve broken something. trust a brandybuck and a took! what? that was just a detour. a short cut. short cut to what? mushrooms! that\\'s mine. that\\'s nice, merry. here\\'s a nice one, sam. i think we should get off the road. get off the road! quick! be quiet! what was that? anything? nothing. what is going on? that black rider was looking for something. or someone. frodo? get down! i have to leave the shire. sam and i must get to bree. right. bucklebury ferry. follow me. run! this way! follow me! run! get the rope, sam! frodo! run, frodo! go! hurry! frodo, come on! come on! faster! jump! how far to the nearest crossing? the brandywine bridge. 20 miles. come on. what do you want? we\\'re heading for the prancing pony. hobbits. four hobbits! what\\'s more, out of the shire by your talk. what business brings you to bree? we wish to stay at the inn. our business is our own. all right young sir, i meant no offense. it\\'s my job to ask questions after nightfall. there\\'s talk of strange folk abroad. can\\'t be too careful. out of the way! watch where you\\'re walking. excuse me. good evening, little masters. what can i do for you? if you\\'re looking for accommodation, we got some nice cozy hobbit-sized rooms available. always proud to cater to little folk, mister ? underhill. my name\\'s underhill. underhill, yeah. we\\'re friends of gandalf the grey. can you tell him we\\'ve arrived? gandalf? gandalf. oh, yes  i remember. elderly chap. big grey beard, pointy hat. not seen him for six months. what do we do now? sam  he\\'ll be here. he\\'ll come. get out of my way! what\\'s that? this, my friend, is a pint. it comes in pints? i\\'m getting one. you got a whole half already! that fellow\\'s done nothing but stare at you since we arrived. excuse me. that man in the corner. who is he? he\\'s one of them rangers. they\\'re dangerous folk they are, wandering the wilds. what his right name is, i\\'ve never heard, but \\'round here he\\'s known as strider. strider. baggins  baggins  baggins  baggins  baggins  baggins? sure, i know a baggins. he\\'s over there. frodo baggins. he\\'s my second cousin, once removed on his mother\\'s side  and my third cousin, twice removed  pippin! steady on, frodo. you cannot hide. i see you. there is no life  in theid. only  death. you draw far too much attention to yourself, “mr. underhill.” what do you want? a little more caution from you. that is no trinket you carry. i carry nothing. indeed. i can avoid being seen if i wish  but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift. who are you? are you frightened? yes. not nearly frightened enough. i know what hunts you. let him go! or i\\'ll have you, longshanks. you have a stout heart, little hobbit. but that will not save you. you can no longer wait for the wizard, frodo. they\\'re coming. what are they? they were once men. great kings of men. then sauron the deceiver gave to them nine rings of power. blinded by their greed, they took them without question. one by one, falling into darkness. now they are slaves to his will. they are the nazgã»l. ringwraiths. neither living nor dead. at all times they feel  the presence of the ring  drawn to the power of the one. they will never stop hunting you. where are you taking us? into the wild. how can we know this strider is a friend of gandalf? i think a servant of the enemy would look fairer  and feel fouler. he\\'s foul enough. we have no choice but to trust him. but where is he leading us? to rivendell, master gamgee. to the house of elrond. did you hear that? rivendell. we\\'re going to see the elves. gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall. what about breakfast? you\\'ve already had it. we\\'ve had one, yes. what about second breakfast? don\\'t think he knows about second breakfast, pip. what about elevenses? luncheon? afternoon tea? dinner? supper? he knows about them, doesn\\'t he? i wouldn\\'t count on it. pippin! what do they eat when they can\\'t get hobbit? tinúviel the elven-fair. immortal maiden elven-wise. about him cast her night-dark hair. and arms like silver glimmering. who is she? this woman you sing of. \\'tis the lay of luthien. the elf-maiden who gave her love to beren, a mortal. what happened to her? she died. get some sleep, frodo. the power of isengard is at your command  sauron, lord of the earth. build me an army worthy of mordor. what orders from mordor, my lord? what does the eye command? we have work to do. the trees are strong, my lord. their roots go deep. rip them all down. this was the great watchtower of amon sûl. we shall rest here tonight. these are for you. keep them close. i\\'m going to have a look around. stay here. my tomato\\'s burst. could i have some bacon? want a tomato, sam? what are you doing?! tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon. we saved some for you, mr. frodo. put it out, you fools! put it out! that\\'s nice! ash on my tomatoes! go! back, you devils! theid-in only death frodo! oh, sam. strider! help him, strider. he\\'s been stabbed by a morgul blade. this is beyond my skill to heal. he needs elvish medicine. hurry! we\\'re six days from rivendell! he\\'ll never make it! hold on, frodo. gandalf! look, frodo. it\\'s mr. bilbo\\'s trolls. mr. frodo? he\\'s going cold. is he going to die? he\\'s passing into the shadow world. he\\'ll soon become a wraith like them. they\\'re close. sam, do you know the athelas plant? athelas? kingsfoil. kingsfoil, aye, it\\'s a weed. it may help to slow the poisoning. hurry! what\\'s this, a ranger caught off his guard? frodo. i am arwen — i\\'ve come to help you. hear myice, come back to the light. who is she? frodo. she\\'s an elf. he\\'s fading. he\\'s not going to last. we must get him to my father. i\\'ve been looking for you for two days. where are you taking him? there are five wraiths behind you. where the other four are, i do not know. stay with the hobbits, i\\'ll send horses for you. i will take him. i am the swifter rider. the road is very dangerous. what are they saying? frodo dies. if i get across the river  the power of my people will protect him. i do not fear them. as you wish. arwen  ride hard. don\\'t look back. ride fast, asfaloth. ride fast! what are you doing?! those wraiths are still out there! ride fast, asfaloth! give up the halfling, she-elf. if you want him, come and claim him. waters of the misty mountains  listen to the great word; flow waters of loudwater against the ringwraiths. waters of the misty mountains  listen to the great word; flow waters of loudwater against the ringwraiths! no. no! frodo, no. frodo, don\\'t give in. not now. what grace is given me  let it pass to him. let him be spared. save him. hear myice come back to the light. where am i? you are in the house of elrond. and it is 10 o\\'clock in the morning on october 24th, if you want to know. gandalf! yes, i\\'m here. and you\\'re lucky to be here too. a few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid. but you have some strength in you, my dear hobbit. what happened, gandalf? why didn\\'t you meet us? i am sorry, frodo. i was delayed. a friendship with saruman is not lightly thrown aside. one ill turn deserves another. it is over. embrace the power of the ring  or embrace your own destruction! there is only one lord of the ring. only one who can bend it to his will. and he does not share power. so you have chosen death. gandalf? what is it? nothing, frodo. frodo! sam. bless you, you\\'re awake! sam has hardly left your side. we were that worried about you. weren\\'t we, mr. gandalf? by the skills of lord elrond, you\\'re beginning to mend. welcome to rivendell, frodo baggins. bilbo! hello, frodo, my lad. bilbo. there and back again a hobbit\\'s tale, by bilbo baggins.\\'\\' this is wonderful. i meant to go back  wonder at the powers of mirkwood  visit lake-town  see the lonely mountain again. but age, it seems, has finally caught up with me. i miss the shire. i spent all my childhood pretending i was off somewhere else. off with you, on one of your adventures. but my own adventure turned out to be quite different. i\\'m not like you, bilbo. my dear boy. now, what have i forgotten? packed already? no harm in being prepared. i thought you wanted to see the elves. i do. more than anything. i did. it\\'s just  we did what gandalf wanted, didn\\'t we? we got the ring this far, to rivendell. and i thought  seeing as how you\\'re on the mend, we\\'d be off soon. off home. you are right, sam. we did what we set out to do. the ring will be safe in rivendell. i am ready to go home. his strength returns. that wound will never fully heal. he will carry it the rest of his life. and yet to have come so far still bearing the ring  the hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil. it is a burden he should never have had to bear. we can ask no more of frodo. gandalf, the enemy is moving. sauron\\'s forces are massing in the east. his eye is fixed on rivendell. and saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us. our list of allies grows thin. his treachery runs deeper than you know. by foul craft, saruman has crossed orcs with goblin-men. he\\'s breeding an army in the caverns of isengard. an army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed. saruman is coming for the ring. this evil cannot be concealed by the power of the elves. we do not have the strength to fight both mordor and isengard! gandalf  the ring cannot stay here. this peril belongs to all middle-earth. they must decide now how to end it. the time of the elves is over. my people are leaving these shores. who will you look to when we\\'ve gone? the dwarves? they hide in mountains seeking riches. they care not for the troubles of others. it is in men that we must place our hope. men? men are weak. the race of men is failing. the blood of numenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity forgotten. it is because of men the ring survives. i was there, gandalf. i was there 3000 years ago  when isildur took the ring. i was there the day the strength of men failed. isildur, hurry! follow me. i led isildur into the heart of mount doom  where the ring was forged, the one place it could be destroyed. cast it into the fire! destroy it! no. isildur! it should have ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure. isildur kept the ring. the line of kings is broken. there\\'s no strength left in the world of men. they\\'re scattered, divided, leaderless. there is one who could unite them. one who could reclaim the throne of gondor. he turned from that path a long time ago. he has chosen exile. you are no elf. men of the south are welcome here. who are you? i am a friend to gandalf the grey. then we are here on common purpose  friend. the shards of narsil. the blade that cut the ring from sauron\\'s hand. it\\'s still sharp. but no more than a broken heirloom. why do you fear the past? you are isildur\\'s heir, not isildur himseif. you are not bound to his fate. the same blood flows in my veins. the same weakness. your time will come. you will face the same evil. and you will defeat it. till now the shadow not masters, aragorn not over you, not over me. do you remember when we first met? i thought i had strayed into a dream. long years have passed. you did not wear the troubles you carry now. do you remember what i told you? you said you\\'d bind yourself to me  forsaking the immortal life of your people. and to that i hold. i would rather share one lifetime with you  than face all the ages of this world alone. i choose a mortal life. you cannot give me this. it is mine to give to whom i will  like my heart. strangers from distant lands, friends of old  you\\'ve been summoned here to answer the threat of mordor. middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction. none can escape it. you will unite, or you will fall. each race is bound to this fate, this one doom. bring forth the ring, frodo. so it is true. the ring of power  the doom of men  in a dream  i saw the eastern sky grow dark  but in the west a pale light lingered. aice was crying: “your doom is near at hand. isildur\\'s bane is found.” in your blood isildur\\'s bane. boromir! “one ring to rule them all  one ring to find them  one ring to bring them all  and in the darkness bind them.” never before has anyice uttered the words of that tongue here in imladris. i do not ask your pardon, master elrond  for the black speech of mordor  may yet be heard  in every corner of the west! the ring is altogether evil. it is a gift. a gift to the foes of mordor. why not use this ring? long has my father, the steward of gondor  kept the forces of mordor at bay. by the blood of our people  are your lands kept safe. give gondor the weapon of the enemy. let us use it against him. you cannot wield it. none of us can. the one ring answers to sauron alone. it has no other master. and what would a ranger know of this matter? this is no mere ranger. he is aragorn, son of arathorn. you owe him your allegiance. aragorn. this is isildur\\'s heir? and heir to the throne of gondor. sit down, legolas. gondor has no king. gondor needs no king. aragorn is right. we cannot use it. you have only one choice. the ring must be destroyed. then what are we waiting for? in the land of mordor where the shadows lie the ring cannot be destroyed, gimli, son of gloin  by any craft that we here possess. the ring was made in the fires of mount doom. one ring to rule them all  only there can it be unmade. it must be taken deep into mordor  and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came. one ring to find them  one of you  must do this. one does not simply walk into mordor. its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs. there is evil there that does not sleep. the great eye is ever-watchful. it is a barren wasteland  riddled with fire, and ash and dust. the very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. not with 10,000 men could you do this. it is folly. have you heard nothing lord elrond has said? the ring must be destroyed. and i suppose you think you are the one to do it! and if we fail, what then? what happens when sauron takes back what is his? i will be dead before i see the ring in the hands of an elf! never trust an elf! do you not understand? while you bicker amongst yourselves, sauron\\'s power grows! none can escape it! you\\'ll all be destroyed! one ring to rule them all  one ring to find them  one ring to rule them all  one ring to find them  one ring to rule them all  one ring to find them  one ring to rule them all  i will take it. i will take it. i will take the ring to mordor. though  i do not know the way. i will help you bear this burden, frodo baggins  as long as it is yours to bear. if by my life or death i can protect you  i will. you have my sword. and you have my bow. and my ax. you carry the fates of us all, little one. if this is indeed the will of the council  then gondor will see it done. mr. frodo\\'s not going anywhere without me. no indeed it is hardly possible to separate you  even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not. oy. we\\'re coming too! you\\'ll have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us. anyway, you need people of intelligence on this sort of  mission. quest. thing. well, that rules you out, pip. nine companions. so be it. you shall be: the fellowship of the ring. great! where are we going? she wanted to protect her child. she thought in rivendell you would be safe. in her heart, your mother knew you\\'d be hunted all your life. that you\\'d never escape your fate. the skill of the elves can reforge the sword of kings  but only you have the power to wield it. i do not want that power. i have never wanted it. you are the last of that bloodline. there is no other. my old sword! sting. here, take it. take it. it\\'s so light. yes, yeah. made by the elves, you know. the blade glows blue when orcs are close. and it\\'s times like that, my lad, when you have to be extra careful. here\\'s a pretty thing. mithril. as light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales. let me see you put it on. come on. my old ring. i should very much like  to hold it again, one last time. i\\'m sorry i brought this upon you, my boy. i\\'m sorry that you must carry this burden. i\\'m sorry for everything. the ring-bearer is setting out on the quest of mount doom. on you who travel with him, no oath  nor bond is laid to go further than you will. farewell. hold to your purpose. may the blessings of elves and men  and all free folk go with you. the fellowship awaits the ring-bearer. mordor, gandalf, is it left or right? left. we must hold to this course, west of the misty mountains, for 40 days. if our luck holds, the gap of rohan will still be open to us. from there, our road turns east to mordor. two, one, five. good! very good. move your feet. you look good, pippin. thanks. faster! if anyone was to ask for my opinion, which i note they\\'re not  i\\'d say we were taking the long way \\'round. gandalf. we could pass through the mines of moria. my cousin balin would give us a royal welcome. no gimli, i would not take the road through moria unless i had no other choice. sorry! get him! for the shire! hold him. hold him down, merry! gentlemen, that\\'s enough. you\\'ve got my arm! you\\'ve got my arm! what is that? nothing. it\\'s just a wisp of cloud. it\\'s moving fast. against the wind. crebain from dunland! hide! merry! take cover! spies of saruman. the passage south is being watched. we must take the pass of caradhras. frodo! boromir. it is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt  over so small a thing. such a little thing. boromir! give the ring to frodo. as you wish. i care not. so, gandalf, you try to lead them over caradhras. and if that fails, where then will you go? if the mountain defeats you  will you risk a more dangerous road? wake up cruel redhorn! there is a fellice on the air. may your horn be bloodstained! it\\'s saruman! he\\'s trying to bring down the mountain! gandalf, we must turn back! no! sleep caradhras, be still, lie still, hold your wrath! wake up cruel redhorn! may your bloodstained horn  fall upon the enemy-heads! we must get off the mountain! make for the gap of rohan, and take the west road to my city! the gap of rohan takes us too close to isengard! we cannot pass over a mountain. let us go under it. let us go through the mines of moria. moria. you fear to go into those mines. the dwarves delved too greedily and too deep. you know what they awoke in the darkness of khazad-dûm: shadow and flame. let the ring-bearer decide. we cannot stay here! this will be the death of the hobbits. frodo? we will go through the mines. so be it. frodo, come and help an old man. how is your shoulder? better than it was. and the ring? you feel its power growing, don\\'t you? i\\'ve felt it too. you must be careful now. evil will be drawn to you from outside the fellowship. and, i fear, from within. who then do i trust? you must trust yourself. trust your own strengths. what do you mean? there are many powers in this world  for good or for evil. some are greater than i am. and against some i have not yet been tested. the walls  of moria. dwarf doors are invisible when closed. yes, gimli, their own masters cannot find them if their secrets are forgotten. why doesn\\'t that surprise me? well, let\\'s see. “moon-star” it mirrors only starlight and moonlight. it reads; “the doors of durin, lord of moria. speak, friend, and enter.” what do you suppose that means? oh it\\'s quite simple. if you are a friend, you speak the password and the doors will open. gate of the elves, open now for me! doorway of the dwarf-folk  listen to the word of my tongue. nothing\\'s happening. i once knew every spell in all the tongues of elves  men and orcs. what are you going to do, then? knock your head against these doors, peregrin took! and if that does not shatter them  and i am allowed a little peace from foolish questions  i will try to find the opening words. gate of elves  listen to my word  threshold of dwarves! mines are no place for a pony. even one so brave as bill. bye-bye, bill. doorway of the dwarf-folk  go on, bill. go on. don\\'t worry, sam, he knows the way home. do not disturb the water. oh, it\\'s useless. it\\'s a riddle. “speak \\'friend\\' and enter.” what\\'s the elvish word for “friend”? mellon. soon, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the dwarves. roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone! this, my friend, is the home of my cousin balin. and they call it a mine. a mine! this is no mine. it\\'s a tomb. no  no! goblins. we make for the gap of rohan. we should never have come here. now, get out of here. get out! frodo! help! strider! help! get off him! aragorn! frodo! into the mines! legolas! into the cave! run! we now have but one choice. we must face the long dark of moria. be on your guard. there are older and fouler things than orcs  in the deep places of the world. quietly now. it\\'s a four-day journey to the other side. let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed. the wealth of moria was not in gold  or jewels  but mithril. bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that thorin gave him. oh, that was a kingly gift. yes. i never told him  but its worth was greater than the value of the shire. pippin. i have no memory of this place. are we lost? no. i think we are. gandalf\\'s thinking. merry? what? i\\'m hungry. there\\'s something down there. it\\'s gollum. gollum? he\\'s been following us for three days. he escaped the dungeons of barad-dûr? escaped  or was set loose. now the ring has brought him here. he will never be rid of his need for it. he hates and loves the ring, as he hates and loves himseif. smeagol\\'s life is a sad story. yes, smeagol he was once called. before the ring found him. before it drove him mad. it\\'s a pity bilbo didn\\'t kill him when he had the chance. pity? it is pity that stayed bilbo\\'s hand. many that live deserve death. some that die deserve life. can you give it to them, frodo? do not be too eager to deal out death and judgment. even the very wise cannot see all ends. my heart tells me that gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill  before this is over. the pity of bilbo may rule the fate of many. i wish the ring had never come to me. i wish none of this had happened. so do all who live to see such times. but that is not for them to decide. all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. there are other forces at work in this world, frodo, besides the will of evil. bilbo was meant to find the ring. in which case, you also were meant to have it. and that is an encouraging thought. it\\'s that way. he\\'s remembered. no. but the air doesn\\'t smell so foul down here. if in doubt, meriadoc, always follow your nose. let me risk a little more light. behold  the great realm and dwarf-city of dwarrowdelf. now there\\'s an eye opener, and no mistake. gimli! no! oh, no. no. “here lies balin  son of fundin  lord of moria.” he is dead, then. it\\'s as i feared. we must move on. we cannot linger. “they have taken the bridge and the second hall. we have barred the gates  but cannot hold them for long. the ground shakes. drums  drums in the deep. we cannot get out. a shadow moves in the dark. we cannot get out. they are coming.” fool of a took! throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity. frodo! orcs. get back! stay close to gandalf! they have a cave-troll. let them come! there is one dwarf yet in moria who still draws breath. i think i\\'m getting the hang of this. frodo! aragorn! aragorn! frodo! frodo! oh, no. he\\'s alive. i\\'m all right. i\\'m not hurt. you should be dead. that spear would have skewered a wild boar. i think there\\'s more to this hobbit than meets the eye. mithril. you are full of surprises, master baggins. to the bridge of khazad-dûm! this way! what is this new devilry? a balrog. a demon of the ancient world. this foe is beyond any of you. run! quickly! gandalf. lead them on, aragorn. the bridge is near. do as i say! swords are no more use here. gandalf! merry! pippin! sam! nobody tosses a dwarf. not the beard! steady. hold on! hang on! lean forward! steady. come on! now! over the bridge! fly! you cannot pass! gandalf! i am a servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of anor. the dark fire will not avail you, flame of udûn! go back to the shadow. you — shall not — pass! no! no! gandalf! fly, you fools! no! aragorn! legolas, get them up. give them a moment, for pity\\'s sake! by nightfall, these hills will be swarming with orcs. we must reach the woods of lothlórien. come, boromir. legolas. gimli, get them up. on your feet, sam. frodo? frodo! stay close, young hobbits! they say that a great sorceress lives in these woods. an elf-witch  of terrible power. all who look upon her  fall under her spell. frodo! and are never seen again. your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom. you bring great evil here, ring-bearer. mr. frodo? well, here\\'s one dwarf she won\\'t ensnare so easily. i have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox. the dwarf breathes so loud, we could have shot him in the dark. well met, legolas son of thranduil. our fellowship stands in your debt,… haldir of lórien. oh, aragorn of the dúnedain  you are known to us. haldir. so much for the legendary courtesy of the elves! speak words we can all understand! we have not had dealings with the dwarves since the dark days. and you know what this dwarf says to that? i spit upon your grave! that was not so courteous. you bring great evil with you. you can go no further. we need your protection. the road is very dangerous. merin le telim. i wish we may come with you. please, understand. we need your support! aragorn! i wish we may come with you. the road is very dangerous. gandalf\\'s death was not in vain. nor would he have you give up hope. you carry a heavy burden, frodo. don\\'t carry the weight of the dead. you will follow me. caras galadhon. the heart of elvendom on earth. realm of the lord celeborn and of galadriel, lady of light. the enemy knows you have entered here. what hope you had in secrecy is now gone. eight there are here, yet nine there were set out from rivendell. tell me, where is gandalf? for i much desire to speak with him. i can no longer see him from afar. gandalf the grey did not pass the borders of this land. he has fallen into shadow. he was taken by both shadow and flame. a balrog of morgoth. for we went needlessly into the net of moria. needless were none of the deeds of gandalf in life. we do not yet know his full purpose. do not let the great emptiness of khazad-dûm fill your heart  gimli, son of gloin. for the world has grown full of peril  and in all lands  love is now mingled with grief. what now becomes of this fellowship? without gandalf, hope is lost. the quest stands upon the edge of a knife. stray but a little and it will fail  to the ruin of all. yet hope remains while the company is true. do not let your hearts be troubled. go now and rest  for you are weary with sorrow and much toil. tonight, you will sleep  welcome, frodo of the shire  one who has seen the eye! a lament for gandalf. what do they say about him? i have not the heart to tell you. for me, the grief is still too near. i bet they don\\'t mention his fireworks. there should be a verse about them. the finest rockets ever seen they burst in stars of blue and green or after thunder, silver showers came falling like a rain of flowers oh, that doesn\\'t do them justice by a long road. take some rest. these borders are well-protected. i will find no rest here. i heard herice inside my head. she spoke of my father and the fall of gondor. she said to me; “even now there is hope left.” but i cannot see it. it is long since we had any hope. my father is a noble man. but his rule is failing  and our people lose faith. he looks to me to make things right, and i would do it. i would see the glory of gondor restored. have you ever seen it, aragorn? the white tower of ecthelion. glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver. its banners caught high in the morning breeze. have you ever been called home  by the clear ringing of silver trumpets? i have seen the white city  long ago. one day, our paths will lead us there. and the tower guard shall take up the call: “the lords of gondor have returned.” will you look into the mirror? what will i see? even the wisest cannot tell. for the mirror  shows many things. things that were  things that are  and some things  that have not yet come to pass. i know what it is you saw. for it is also in my mind. it is what will come to pass if you should fail. the fellowship is breaking. it is already begun. he will try to take the ring. you know of whom i speak. one by one, it will destroy them all. if you ask it of me  i will give you the one ring. you offer it to me freely. i do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this. in place of a dark lord, you would have a queen  not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn! treacherous as the sea! stronger than the foundations of the earth! all shall love me  and despair. i pass the test. i will diminish  and go into the west  and remain galadriel. i cannot do this alone. you are a ring-bearer, frodo. to bear a ring of power  is to be alone. this is nenya, the ring of adamant. and i am its keeper. this task was appointed to you. and if you do not find a way  no one will. then i know what i must do. it\\'s just  i\\'m afraid to do it. even the smallest person can change the course of the future. do you know how the orcs first came into being? they were elves once. taken by the dark powers  tortured and mutilated. a ruined and terrible form of life. and now  perfected. my fighting uruk-hai  whom do you serve? saruman! hunt them down. do not stop until, they are found. you do not know pain. you do not know fear. you will taste man-flesh! one of the halflings carries something of great value. bring them to me alive and unspoiled. kill the others. never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people. may these cloaks help shield you from unfriendly eyes. lembas. elvish waybread. one small bite is enough to fill the stomach of a grown man. how many did you eat? four. every league you travel south, the danger will increase. mordor orcs now hold the eastern shore of the anduin. nor will you find safety on the western bank. strange creatures bearing the mark of the white hand have been seen on our borders. seldom do orcs journey in the open under the sun, yet these have done so. you are being followed. by river you have the chance of outrunning the enemy to the falls of rauros. my gift for you, legolas, is a bow of the galadhrim. worthy of the skill of our woodland kin. these are the daggers of the noldorin. they have already seen service in war. do not fear, young peregrin took. you will find your courage. and for you, samwise gamgee  elven rope made of hithlain. thank you, my lady. have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers? and what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves? nothing. except to look upon the lady of the galadhrim one last time  for she is more fair than all the jewels beneath the earth. actually  there was one thing. no, no, i couidn\\'t. it\\'s quite impossible. stupid to ask. i have nothing greater to give  than the gift you already bear. for her love  the gift of life of arwen will dwindle. i wish that she endures, even if we separate  beyond the limits of this world. i wish that she sails to valinor. that choice is yet before her. you have your own choice to make, aragorn. to rise above the height of all your fathers since the days of elendil  or to fall into darkness with all that is left of your kin. farewell. there is much you have yet to do. we shall not meet again, elessar. farewell, frodo baggins. i give you the light of earendil  our most beloved star. may it be a light for you in dark places  when all other lights go out. i have taken my worst wound at this parting  having looked my last upon that which is fairest. henceforth i will call nothing fair unless it be her gift to me. what was her gift? i asked her for one hair from her golden head. she gave me three. gollum. he has tracked us since moria. i had hoped we would lose him on the river. but he\\'s too clever a waterman. and if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts  it will make the crossing even more dangerous. have some food, mr. frodo. no, sam. you haven\\'t eaten anything all day. you\\'re not sleeping, neither. don\\'t think i haven\\'t noticed. mr. frodo i\\'m all right. but you\\'re not. i\\'m here to help you. i promised gandalf that i would. you can\\'t help me, sam. not this time. get some sleep. minas tirith is the safer road. you know that. from there we can regroup. strike out for mordor from a place of strength. there is no strength in gondor that can avail us. you were quick enough to trust the elves. have you so little faith in your own people? yes, there is weakness. there is frailty. but there is courage also, and honor to be found in men. but you will not see that. you are afraid! all your life, you have hidden in the shadows. scared of who you are, of what you are. i will not lead the ring within a hundred leagues of your city. frodo. the argonath. long have i desired to look upon the kings of old. my kin. we cross the lake at nightfall. hide the boats and continue on foot. we approach mordor from the north. oh, yes? just a simple matter of finding our way through emyn muil  an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks. and after that, it gets even better. festering, stinking marshland as far as the eye can see. that is our road. i suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, master dwarf. recover my  we should leave now. no. orcs patrol the eastern shore. we must wait for cover of darkness. it is not the eastern shore that worries me. a shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind. something draws near. i can feel it. recover strength? pay no heed to that, young hobbit. where\\'s frodo? none of us should wander alone. you, least of all. so much depends on you. frodo? i know why you seek solitude. you suffer. i see it day by day. you sure you do not suffer needlessly? there are other ways, frodo. other paths that we might take. i know what you would say. it would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart. warning against what? we\\'re all afraid, frodo. but to let that fear drive us, to destroy what hope we have  don\\'t you see that is madness? there is no other way. i ask only for the strength to defend my people! if you would but lend me the ring. no. why do you recoil? i am no thief. you are not yourself. what chance do you think you have? they will find you. they will take the ring. and you will beg for death before the end! you fool! it is not yours, save by unhappy chance! it could have been mine. it should be mine! give it to me! give it to me! no! give it to me! no. i see your mind. you will take the ring to sauron! you will betray us! you\\'ll go to your death, and the death of us all! curse you! curse you and all the halflings! frodo? frodo. what have i done? please, frodo. frodo, i\\'m sorry! here inid, only death. frodo? it has taken boromir. where is the ring? stay away! frodo! i swore to protect you. can you protect me from yourself? would you destroy it? aragorn. aragorn. elessar. i would have gone with you to the end. into the very fires of mordor. i know. look after the others. especially sam. he will not understand. go, frodo! run. run! mr. frodo! find the halfling! find the halfling! elendil! aragorn, go! frodo! hide here. quick! come on! what\\'s he doing? he\\'s leaving. no! pippin! run, frodo. go! hey! hey, you! over here! hey! over here! this way! it\\'s working! i know it\\'s working! run! the horn of gondor. boromir. run! no. they took the little ones. hold still. frodo. where is frodo? i let frodo go. then you did what i could not. i tried to take the ring from him. the ring is beyond our reach now. forgive me. i did not see it. i have failed you all. no, boromir. you fought bravely. you have kept your honor. leave it. it is over. the world of men will fall and all will come to darkness  and my city to ruin. i do not know what strength is in my blood  but i swear to you, i will not let the white city fall  nor our people fail. our people. our people. i would have followed you, my brother. my captain. my king. be at peace  son of gondor. they will look for his coming from the white tower. but he will not return. frodo! i wish the ring had never come to me. i wish none of this had happened. so do all who live to see such times  but that is not for them to decide. all you have to decide  is what to do with the time that is given to you. frodo, no! frodo! mr. frodo! no, sam. go back, sam! i\\'m going to mordor alone. of course you are. and i\\'m coming with you! you can\\'t swim! sam! sam! i made a promise, mr. frodo. a promise: “don\\'t you leave him, samwise gamgee.” and i don\\'t mean to. i don\\'t mean to. oh sam. come on. hurry! frodo and sam have reached the eastern shore. you mean not to follow them. frodo\\'s fate is no longer in our hands. then it has all been in vain. the fellowship has failed. not if we hold true to each other. we will not abandon merry and pippin to torment and death. not while we have strength left. leave all that can be spared behind. we travel light. let us hunt some orc. yes! mordor. i hope the others find a safer road. strider will look after them. i don\\'t suppose we\\'ll ever see them again. we may yet, mr. frodo. we may. sam  i\\'m glad you\\'re with me. you cannot pass! gandalf! i am a servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of anor. go back to the shadow. the dark fire will not avail you, flame of udun! you shall not pass! no! no! gandalf! fly, you fools. no! gandalf! gandalf! what is it, mr. frodo? nothing. just a dream. can you see the bottom? no! don\\'t look down, sam! just keep going! catch it! grab it, mr. frodo! mr. frodo! i think i\\'ve found the bottom. bogs and rope, and goodness knows what. it\\'s not natural. none of it. what\\'s in this? nothing. just a bit of seasoning. i thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something. roast chicken?! you never know. sam. my dear sam. it\\'s very special, that. it\\'s the best salt in all the shire. it is special. it\\'s a little bit of home. we can\\'t leave this here for someone to follow us down. who\\'s gonna follow us down here, mr. frodo? it\\'s a shame, really. lady galadriel gave me that. real elvish rope. well, there\\'s nothing for it. it\\'s one of my knots. won\\'t come free in a hurry. real elvish rope. mordor. the one place in middle-earth we don\\'t want to see any closer. and it\\'s the one place we\\'re trying to get to. it\\'s just where we can\\'t get. let\\'s face it, mr. frodo, we\\'re lost. i don\\'t think gandalf meant for us to come this way. he didn\\'t mean for a lot of things to happen, sam  but they did. mr. frodo? it\\'s the ring, isn\\'t it? it\\'s getting heavier. what food have we got left? well, let me see. oh, yes. lovely. lembas bread. and look! more lembas bread. i don\\'t usually hold with foreign food  but this elvish stuff, it\\'s not bad. nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, sam? those rain clouds might. this looks strangely familiar. it\\'s because we\\'ve been here before. we\\'re going in circles. what is that horrid stink? i warrant there\\'s a nasty bog nearby. can you smell it? yes. i can smell it. we\\'re not alone. the thieves. the thieves. the filthy little thieves. where is it? where is it? they stole it from us. my precious. curse them, we hates them! it\\'s ours, it is, and we wants it! this is sting. you\\'ve seen it before  haven\\'t you, gollum? release him or i\\'ll cut your throat. it burns! it burns us! it freezes! nasty elves twisted it. take it off us! quiet, you! it\\'s hopeless. every orc in mordor\\'s going to hear this racket. let\\'s just tie him up and leave him. no! that would kill us! kill us! it\\'s no more than you deserve! maybe he does deserve to die. but now that i see him, i do pity him. we be nice to them if they be nice to us. take it off us. we swears to do what you wants. we swears. there\\'s no promise you can make that i can trust. we swears  to serve the master of the precious. we will swear on  on the precious. gollum. gollum. the ring is treacherous. it will hold you to your word. yes  on the precious. on the precious. i don\\'t believe you! get down! i said, down! sam! he\\'s trying to trick us. if we let him go, he\\'ll throttle us in our sleep. you know the way to mordor? yes. you\\'ve been there before? yes. you will lead us to the black gate. to the gate, to the gate! to the gate, the master says. yes! no! we won\\'t go back. not there. not to him. they can\\'t make us. gollum! gollum! but we swore to serve the master of the precious. no. ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits. and orcses, thousands of orcses. and always the great eye watching, watching. hey! come back now! come back! there! what did i tell you? he\\'s run off, the old villain. so much for his promises. this way, hobbits. follow me! merry! merry! you\\'re late. our master grows impatient. he wants the shire-rats now. i don\\'t take orders from orc-maggots. saruman will have his prize. we will deliver them. merry! merry? wake up. my friend is sick. he needs water. please! sick, is he? give him some medicine, boys! stop it! can\\'t take his draught! leave him alone! why? you want some? then keep your mouth shut. merry. hello, pip. you\\'re hurt. i\\'m fine. it was just an act. an act? see? i fooled you too. don\\'t worry about me, pip. what is it? what do you smell? man-flesh. they\\'ve picked up our trail. aragorn. let\\'s move! their pace has quickened. they must have caught our scent. hurry! come on, gimli! three days and nights pursuit. no food. no rest. and no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell. not idly do the leaves of lorien fall. they may yet be alive. less than a day ahead of us. come. come, gimli! we\\'re gaining on them! i\\'m wasted on cross-country. we dwarves are natural sprinters. very dangerous over short distances. rohan. home of the horse-lords. there\\'s something strange at work here. some evil gives speed to these creatures. sets its will against us. legolas! what do your elf-eyes see? the uruks turn northeast. they\\'re taking the hobbits to isengard. saruman. the world is changing. who now has the strength to stand against the armies of isengard  and mordor? to stand against the might of sauron and saruman  and the union of the two towers? together, my lord sauron  we shall rule this middle-earth. the old world will burn in the fires of industry. the forests will fall. a new order will rise. we will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear  and the iron fists of the orc. i want them armed and ready to march within two weeks! but, my lord, there are too many! they cannot all be armed in time, we don\\'t have the means. build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day. we don\\'t have enough fuel to feed the fires. the forest of fangorn lies on our doorstep. burn it. yes. we will fight for you. swear it. we will die for saruman. the horse-men took your lands. they drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks. murderers! take back the lands they stole from you. burn every village! we have only to remove those who oppose us. it will begin in rohan. too long have these peasants stood against you. but no more. eothain! eothain! you take your sister. you\\'ll go faster with just two. papa says eothain must not ride garulf. he is too big for him. listen to me. you must ride to edoras and raise the alarm. do you understand me? yes, mama. i don\\'t want to leave. i don\\'t want to go, mama. freda, i will find you there. quickly! go, child. rohan, my lord  is ready to fall. theodred. find the king\\'s son! mordor will pay for this. these orcs are not from mordor. my lord eomer, over here! he\\'s alive. theodred. your son is badly wounded, my lord. he was ambushed by orcs. if we don\\'t defend our country, saruman will take it by force. that is a lie. saruman the white has ever been our friend and ally. grima. grima. grima. orcs are roaming freely across our lands. unchecked. unchallenged. killing at will. orcs bearing the white hand of saruman. why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind? can you not see? your uncle is wearied by your malcontent  your warmongering. warmongering? how long is it since saruman bought you? what was the promised price, grima? when all the men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure? too long have you watched my sister. too long have you haunted her steps. you see much, eomer, son of eomund. too much. you are banished forthwith from the kingdom of rohan  and all its domains under pain of death. you have no authority here. your orders mean nothing. this order does not come from me. it comes from the king. he signed it this morning. keep breathing. that\\'s the key. breathe. they\\'ve run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them. we\\'re not going no further  until we\\'ve had a breather. get a fire going! merry! merry! i think we might have made a mistake leaving the shire, pippin. what\\'s making that noise? it\\'s the trees. what? you remember the old forest, on the borders of buckland? folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall  and come alive. alive? trees that could whisper  talk to each other  even move. i\\'m starving. we ain\\'t had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days. yeah! why can\\'t we have some meats?! what about them? they\\'re fresh. they are not for eating. what about their legs? they don\\'t need those. they look tasty. get back, scum! the prisoners go to saruman. alive and unspoiled. alive? why alive? do they give good sport? they have something. an elvish weapon. the master wants it for the war. they think we have the ring. as soon as they find out we don\\'t, we\\'re dead. just a mouthful  a bit of the flank. looks like meat\\'s back on the menu, boys. pippin. let\\'s go. go on. call for help. squeal. no one\\'s gonna save you now. pippin! a red sun rises. blood has been spilled this night. riders of rohan  what news from the mark? what business does an elf, a man and a dwarf have in the riddermark? speak quickly! give me your name, horse-master, and i shall give you mine. i would cut off your head, dwarf  if it stood but a little higher from the ground. you would die before your stroke fell. i am aragorn, son of arathorn. this is gimli, son of gloin, and legolas of the woodland realm. we are friends of rohan and of theoden, your king. theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe. not even his own kin. saruman has poisoned the mind of the king  and claimed lordship over these lands. my company are those loyal to rohan. and for that, we are banished. the white wizard is cunning. he walks here and there, they say  as an old man hooded and cloaked. and everywhere, his spies slip past our nets. we are no spies. we track a party of uruk-hai westward across the plain. they have taken two of our friends captive. the uruks are destroyed. we slaughtered them during the night. but there were two hobbits. did you see two hobbits with them? they would be small. only children to your eyes. we left none alive. we piled the carcasses and burned them. dead? i am sorry. hasufel! arod! may these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters. farewell. look for your friends. but do not trust to hope. it has forsaken these lands. we ride north! it\\'s one of their wee belts. may they find peace after death. we failed them. a hobbit lay here. and the other. they crawled. their hands were bound. their bonds were cut. they ran over here. they were followed. the belt! run! tracks lead away from the battle  into fangorn forest. fangorn? what madness drove them in there? did we lose him? i think we lost him. i\\'m going to rip out your filthy little innards! come here! trees. climb a tree. he\\'s gone. merry! let\\'s put a maggot hole in your belly! run, merry! little orcs. bru-ra-hroom. it\\'s talking, merry. the tree is talking. tree? i am no tree! i am an ent. a tree-herder. a shepherd of the forest. don\\'t talk to it, merry. don\\'t encourage it! treebeard, some call me. and whose side are you on? side? i am on nobody\\'s side  because nobody\\'s on my side, little orc. nobody cares for the woods anymore. we\\'re not orcs! we\\'re hobbits! hobbits? never heard of a hobbit before. sounds like orc mischief to me! they come with fire. they come with axes. gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning! destroyers and usurpers! curse them! no! you don\\'t understand. we\\'re hobbits! halflings! shire-folk! maybe you are  and maybe you aren\\'t. the white wizard will know. the white wizard? saruman. see? see? we\\'ve led you out. hurry, hobbitses. hurry! very lucky we find you. nice hobbit. it\\'s a bog. he\\'s led us into a swamp. a swamp, yes, yes. come, master. we will take you on safe paths through the mist. come, hobbits! come! we go quickly. i found it. i did. the way through the marshes. orcs don\\'t use it. orcs don\\'t know it. they go round for miles and miles. come quickly. soft and quick as shadows we must be. i hate this place. it\\'s too quiet. there\\'s been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days. no, no birdses to eat. no crunchable birdses. we are famished! yes! famished we are, precious! here. what does it eats? is it tasty? it tries to chokes us! we can\\'t eats hobbit food! we must starve! well, starve, then. and good riddance! oh, cruel hobbit. it does not care if we be hungry. it does not care if we should die. not like master. master cares. master knows. yes. precious. once it takes hold of us  it never lets go. don\\'t touch me! there are dead things! dead faces in the water. all dead. all rotten. elves and men and orcses. a great battle long ago. dead marshes. yes. yes, that is their name. this way. don\\'t follow the lights. careful now! or hobbits go down to join the dead ones  and light little candles of their own. frodo! gollum? don\\'t follow the lights. gollum! mr. frodo! are you all right? so bright. so beautiful. our precious. what did you say? master should be resting. master needs to keep up his strength. who are you? mustn\\'t ask us. not its business. gollum. gollum. gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk. cold be heart and hand and bone cold be travelers far from home he said your life was a sad story. they do not see what lies ahead when sun has failed and moon is dead you were not so very different from a hobbit once. were you? smeagol. what did you call me? that was your name once, wasn\\'t it? a long time ago. my name. my name. smeagol. black riders! hide! hide! come on, frodo. come on! quick! they will see us! they will see us! i thought they were dead. dead? no, you cannot kill them. no. wraiths! wraiths on wings! they are calling for it. they are calling for the precious. mr. frodo! it\\'s all right. i\\'m here. hurry, hobbits. the black gate is very close. orc blood. these are strange tracks. the air is so close in here. this forest is old. very old. full of memory  and anger. the trees are speaking to each other. gimli! lower your ax. they have feelings, my friend. the elves began it. waking up the trees, teaching them to speak. talking trees. what do trees have to talk about? except the consistency of squirrel droppings. aragorn, something is out there! what do you see? the white wizard approaches. do not let him speak. he will put a spell on us. we must be quick. you are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits. where are they? they passed this way the day before yesterday. they met someone they did not expect. does that comfort you? who are you? show yourself! it cannot be. forgive me. i mistook you for saruman. i am saruman. or rather, saruman as he should have been. you fell. through fire  and water. from the lowest dungeon to the highest peak  i fought with the balrog of morgoth. until at last i threw down my enemy  and smote his ruin upon the mountainside. darkness took me  and i strayed out of thought and time. stars wheeled overhead  and every day was as long as a life age of the earth. but it was not the end. i felt life in me again. i\\'ve been sent back  until my task is done. gandalf. gandalf? yes. that was what they used to call me. gandalf the grey. that was my name. gandalf. i am gandalf the white. and i come back to you now  at the turn of the tide. one stage of your journey is over. another begins. we must travel to edoras with all speed. edoras? that is no short distance! we hear of trouble in rohan. it goes ill with the king. yes, and it will not be easily cured. then we have run all this way for nothing? are we to leave those poor hobbits here  in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested ? i mean, charming  quite charming forest. it was more than mere chance that brought merry and pippin to fangorn. a great power has been sleeping here for many long years. the coming of merry and pippin will be like the falling of small stones  that starts an avalanche in the mountains. in one thing you have not changed, dear friend. you still speak in riddles. a thing is about to happen that has not happened since the elder days. the ents are going to wake up  and find that they are strong. strong?! oh, that\\'s good. so stop your fretting, master dwarf. merry and pippin are quite safe. in fact, they are far safer than you are about to be. this new gandalf\\'s more grumpy than the old one. that is one of the mearas  unless my eyes are cheated by some spell. shadowfax. he is the lord of all horses  and has been my friend through many dangers. o rowan mine i saw you shine upon a summer\\'s day upon your head how golden-red the crown you bore aloft such a beautiful verse. is it much further? bru-ra-hroom. don\\'t be hasty. you might call it far, perhaps. my home lies deep in the forest  near the roots of the mountain. i told gandalf i would keep you safe. and safe is where i\\'ll keep you. i believe you will enjoy this next one too. it\\'s one of my own compositions. right. beneath the roof of sleeping leaves and the dreams of trees unfold when woodland halls are green and cool and the wind is in the west come back to me come back to me and say my land is best sleep, little shirelings. heed no nightly noise. sleep till morning light. i have business in the forest. there are many to call. many that must come. the shadow lies on fangorn. the withering of all woods is drawing near. the veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape. sauron will suffer no rival. from the summit of barad-dur, his eye watches ceaselessly. but he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear. doubt ever gnaws at him. the rumor has reached him. the heir of numenor still lives. sauron fears you, aragorn. he fears what you may become. and so he\\'ll strike hard and fast at the world of men. he will use his puppet saruman to destroy rohan. war is coming. rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge  for rohan is weak and ready to fall. the king\\'s mind is enslaved, it\\'s an old device of saruman\\'s. his hold over king theoden is now very strong. sauron and saruman are tightening the noose. but for all their cunning  we have one advantage. the ring remains hidden. and that we should seek to destroy it  has not yet entered their darkest dreams. and so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards mordor  in the hands of a hobbit. each day brings it closer to the fires of mount doom. we must trust now in frodo. everything depends upon speed  and the secrecy of his quest. do not regret your decision to leave him. frodo must finish this task alone. he\\'s not alone. sam went with him. did he? did he, indeed? good. yes, very good. the black gate of mordor. oh, save us. my old gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now. master says to show him the way into mordor. so good smeagol does, master says so. i did. that\\'s it, then. we can\\'t get past that. look! the gate. it\\'s opening! i can see a way down. sam, no! master! i do not ask you to come with me, sam. i know, mr. frodo. i doubt even these elvish cloaks will hide us in there. now! no! no! no, master! they catch you! they catch you! don\\'t take it to him. he wants the precious. always he is looking for it. and the precious is wanting to go back to him. but we mustn\\'t let him have it. no! there\\'s another way. more secret. a dark way. why haven\\'t you spoken of this before? because master did not ask. he\\'s up to something. are you saying there\\'s another way into mordor? yes. there\\'s a path  and some stairs. and then  a tunnel. he\\'s led us this far, sam. mr. frodo, no. he\\'s been true to his word. no. lead the way, smeagol. good smeagol always helps. hello? treebeard? where has he gone? i had the loveliest dream last night. there was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed. and we smoked all of it. and then  you were sick. i\\'d give anything for a whiff of old toby. did you hear that? there it is again. something\\'s not right here. not right at all. you just said something treeish. no, i didn\\'t. i was just stretching. you\\'re taller. who? you! than what? than me! i\\'ve always been taller than you. pippin, everyone knows i\\'m the tall one. you\\'re the short one. please, merry. you\\'re what? three-foot-six? at the most? whereas me, i\\'m pushing 3\\'7\". 3\\'8\"! three-foot-eight. you did something. merry, don\\'t! don\\'t drink it! merry! treebeard said, treebeard said you shouldn\\'t have any. i want some! he said it could well be dangerous! give me it back. merry! what\\'s happening?! it\\'s got my leg! merry! help! away with you. you should not be waking. eat earth. dig deep. drink water. go to sleep. away with you. come, the forest is waking up. it isn\\'t safe. the trees have grown wild and dangerous. anger festers in their hearts. black are their thoughts. strong is their hate. they will harm you if they can. there are too few of us now. too few of us ents left to manage them. why are there so few of you when you have lived so long? are there ent children? bru-ra-hroom. there have been no entings for a terrible long count of years. why is that? we lost the entwives. oh, i\\'m sorry. how did they die? die? no. we lost them. and now we cannot find them. i don\\'t suppose you\\'ve seen entwives in the shire? can\\'t say that i have. you, pip? what do they look like? i don\\'t remember now. edoras and the golden hall of meduseld. there dwells theoden, king of rohan  whose mind is overthrown. saruman\\'s hold over king theoden is now very strong. my lord, your son  he is dead. my lord? uncle? will you not go to him? will you do nothing? be careful what you say. do not look for welcome here. oh, he he must have died sometime in the night. what a tragedy for the king  to lose his only son and heir. i understand. his passing is hard to accept. especially now that your brother has deserted you. leave me alone, snake! oh, but you are alone. who knows what you\\'ve spoken to the darkness  in the bitter watches of the night  when all your life seems to shrink. the walls of your bower closing in about you. a hutch to trammel some wild thing in. so fair. so cold. like a morning of pale spring  still clinging to winter\\'s chill. your words are poison. you\\'ll find more cheer in a graveyard. i cannot allow you before theoden king so armed, gandalf greyhame. by order of grima wormtongue. your staff. you would not part an old man from his walking stick. my lord, gandalf the grey is coming. he\\'s a herald of woe. the courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late  theoden king. he\\'s not welcome. why should i welcome you  gandalf stormcrow? a just question, my liege. late is the hour  in which this conjurer chooses to appear. lathspell i name him. ill news is an ill guest. be silent. keep your forked tongue behind your teeth. i have not passed through fire and death  to bandy crooked words with a witless worm. his staff. i told you to take the wizard\\'s staff. theoden  son of thengel  too long have you sat in the shadows. i would stay still if i were you. hearken to me! i release you  from the spell. you have no power here  gandalf the grey. i will draw you, saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound. wait. if i go, theoden dies. you did not kill me  you will not kill him. rohan is mine. be gone. i know your face. eowyn. eowyn. gandalf? breathe the free air again, my friend. dark have been my dreams of late. your fingers would remember their old strength better  if they grasped your sword. i\\'ve only  ever served you, my lord. your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast! send me not from your sight. no, my lord! no, my lord. let him go. enough blood has been spilt on his account. get out of my way! hail, theoden king! where is theodred? where is my son? an evil death has set forth the noble warrior  a song shall sing sorrowing minstrels. in meduseld  that he is no more  for his necessary rest. and that he is the dearest kinsman  killing took him  simbelmyn. ever has it grown on the tombs of my forbearers. now it shall cover the grave of my son. alas that these evil days should be mine. the young perish and the old linger. that i should live  to see the last days of my house. theodred\\'s death was not of your making. no parent should have to bury their child. he was strong in life. his spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers. be thou well. go thou, théodred, go thou. they had no warning. they were unarmed. now the wild men are moving through the westfold, burning as they go. rick, cot and tree. where is mama? this is but a taste of the terror that saruman will unleash. all the more potent for he is driven now by fear of sauron. ride out and meet him head on. draw him away from your women and children. you must fight. you have 2000 good men riding north as we speak. eomer is loyal to you. his men will return and fight for their king. they will be 300 leagues from here by now. eomer cannot help us. i know what it is you want of me  but i will not bring further death to my people. i will not risk open war. open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not. when last i looked  theoden, not aragorn, was king of rohan. then what is the king\\'s decision? by order of the king  the city must empty. we make for the refuge of helm\\'s deep. do not burden yourself with treasures. take only what provisions you need. helm\\'s deep. they flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight. who will defend them if not their king? he\\'s only doing what he thinks is best for his people. helm\\'s deep has saved them in the past. there is no way out of that ravine. theoden is walking into a trap. he thinks he\\'s leading them to safety. what they will get is a massacre. theoden has a strong will, but i fear for him. i fear for the survival of rohan. he will need you before the end, aragorn. the people of rohan will need you. the defenses have to hold. they will hold. the grey pilgrim. that\\'s what they used to call me. three hundred lives of men i\\'ve walked this earth, and now i have no time. with luck, my search will not be in vain. look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. at dawn, look to the east. go. that horse is half mad, my lord. there\\'s nothing you can do. leave him. fast  quiet now. fast  quiet  quiet  quiet  quiet  a battle is stirring, you heard. what is your name? what is your name? his name is brego. he was my cousin\\'s horse. brego. your name is kingly. what troubles you, brego? what did you see? i have heard of the magic of elves  but i did not look for it in a ranger from the north. you speak as one of their own. i was raised in rivendell  for a time. turn this fellow free. he\\'s seen enough of war. gandalf the white. gandalf the fool! does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety? there were three who followed the wizard. an elf, a dwarf and a man. you stink of horse. the man  was he from gondor? no, from the north. one of the dunedain rangers, i thought he was. his cloth was poor. and yet he bore a strange ring. two serpents with emerald eyes. one devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers. the ring of barahir. so gandalf greyhame thinks he has found isildur\\'s heir. the lost king of gondor. he is a fool. the line was broken years ago. it matters not. the world of men shall fall. it will begin at edoras. i am ready, gamling. bring my horse. this is not a defeat. we will return. we will return. you have some skill with a blade. women of this country learned long ago: those without swords can still die upon them. i fear neither death nor pain. what do you fear, my lady? a cage. to stay behind bars until use and old age accept them. and all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire. you\\'re a daughter of kings  a shield maiden of rohan. i do not think that would be your fate. theoden will not stay at edoras. it\\'s vulnerable. he knows this. he will expect an attack on the city. they will flee to helm\\'s deep  the great fortress of rohan. it is a dangerous road to take through the mountains. they will be slow. they will have women and children with them. send out your warg-riders. hey, stinker, don\\'t go getting too far ahead. why do you do that? what? call him names. run him down all the time. because. because that\\'s what he is, mr. frodo. there\\'s naught left in him but lies and deceit. it\\'s the ring he wants. it\\'s all he cares about. you have no idea what it did to him  what it\\'s still doing to him. i want to help him, sam. why? because i have to believe he can come back. you can\\'t save him, mr. frodo. what do you know about it? nothing! i\\'m sorry, sam. i don\\'t know why i said that. i do. it\\'s the ring. you can\\'t take your eyes off it. i\\'ve seen you. you\\'re not eating. you barely sleep. it\\'s taken hold of you, mr. frodo. you have to fight it. i know what i have to do, sam. the ring was entrusted to me. it\\'s my task. mine! my own! can\\'t you hear yourself? don\\'t you know who you sound like? we wants it. we needs it. must have the precious. they stole it from us. sneaky little hobbitses. wicked. tricksy. false. no. not master. yes, precious. false. they will cheat you, hurt you, lie! master\\'s my friend. you don\\'t have any friends. nobody likes you. not listening. i\\'m not listening. you\\'re a liar and a thief. no. murderer. go away. go away? i hate you. i hate you. where would you be without me? gollum. gollum. i saved us. it was me. we survived because of me. not anymore. what did you say? master looks after us now. we don\\'t need you. what? leave now  and never come back. no. leave now and never come back. leave now and never come back! we we told him to go away. and away he goes, precious. gone! gone! gone! smeagol is free! look. look. see what smeagol finds? they are young. they are tender. they are nice. yes, they are. eat them. eat them! you\\'ll make him sick, you will  behaving like that. there\\'s only one way to eat a brace of coneys. what\\'s it doing? stupid, fat hobbit. it ruins it. what\\'s to ruin? there\\'s hardly any meat on \\'em. waht we need\\'s a few good taters. what\\'s taters, precious? what\\'s taters? eh? po-ta-toes. boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew. lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish. even you couldn\\'t say no to that. oh, yes, we could. spoil a nice fish. give it to us raw  and wriggling. you keep nasty chips. you\\'re hopeless. mr. frodo? who are they? wicked men. servants of sauron. they are called to mordor. the dark one is gathering all armies to him. it won\\'t be long now. he will soon be ready. ready to do what? to make his war. the last war that will cover all the world in shadow. we\\'ve got to get moving. come on, sam. mr. frodo. look. it\\'s an oliphaunt. no one at home will believe this. smeagol? we\\'ve lingered here too long. come on, sam. wait! we\\'re innocent travelers! there are no travelers in this land. only servants of the dark tower. we are bound to an errand of secrecy. those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us. the enemy? his sense of duty was no less than yours, i deem. you wonder what his name is  where he came from. and if he was really evil at heart. what lies or threats led him on this long march from home. if he would not rather have stayed there  in peace. war will make corpses of us all. bind their hands. it\\'s true, you don\\'t see many dwarf women. and in fact, they are so alike inice and appearance  that they\\'re often mistaken for dwarf men. it\\'s the beards. this, in turn, has given rise to the belief  that there are no dwarf women  and that dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground  which is, of course, ridiculous. it\\'s all right. it\\'s all right. nobody panic. that was deliberate. it was deliberate. i haven\\'t seen my niece smile for a long time. she was a girl when they brought her father back dead. cut down by orcs. she watched her mother succumb to grief. then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear. doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father. gimli. no, i couldn\\'t i really couldn\\'t. i made some stew. it isn\\'t much, but it\\'s hot. thank you. it\\'s good. really? my uncle told me a strange thing. he said that you rode to war with thengel, my grandfather. but he must be mistaken. king theoden has a good memory. he was only a small child at the time. then you must be at least 60. seventy? but you cannot be 80! eighty-seven. you are one of the dunedain. a descendant of numenor, blessed with long life. it was said that your race had passed into legend. there are few of us left. the northern kingdom was destroyed long ago. i\\'m sorry. please, eat. the light of the evenstar does not wax and wane. it is mine to give to whom i will. like my heart. go to sleep. i am asleep. this is a dream. then it is a good dream. sleep. you told me once  this day would come. this is not the end it is the beginning. you must go with frodo. that is your path. my path is hidden from me. it is already laid before your feet. you cannot falter now. arwen  if you trust nothing else  trust this  trust us. where is she? the woman who gave you that jewel. our time here is ending. arwen\\'s time is ending. let her go. let her take the ship into the west. let her bear away her love for you to the undying lands. there it will be ever green. but never more than memory. i will not leave my daughter here to die. she stays because she still has hope. she stays for you. she belongs with her people. sharepirate.com subs is this how you leave? did you think you could slip away at first light unseen? i shall not return. you underestimate your skill in battle. you will return. i do not speak of death in battle. what do you speak of? the way is open to you  the way to another life  away from war grief, despair. why are you saying this? i am mortal. you are elf-kind. it was a dream, arwen. nothing more. i don\\'t believe you. this belongs to you. it was a gift. keep it. my lord? she is sailing to the undying lands with all that is left of her kin. what is it? hama? i\\'m not sure. wargs! a scout! what is it? what do you see? warg! we\\'re under attack! get them out of here! all riders to the head of the column. come on. get me up here. i\\'m a rider. come on! you must lead the people to helm\\'s deep, and make haste. i can fight. no! you must do this, for me. follow me! forward. i mean, charge forward. make for the lower ground! that\\'s it! go on! stay together! bring your pretty face to my ax. that one counts as mine! stinking creature. aragorn! aragorn? tell me what happened and i will ease your passing. he\\'s  dead. he took a little tumble off the cliff. you lie. get the wounded on horses. the wolves of isengard will return. leave the dead. come. at last! helm\\'s deep. there it is, helm\\'s deep. we\\'re safe! we\\'re safe, my lady. thank you. mama! eothain! freda! where is the rest? this is all we could save, my lady. take it to the caves. make way for the king. make way for theoden. make way for the king. so few. so few of you have returned. our people are safe. we have paid for it with many lives. my lady. lord aragorn  where is he? he fell. draw all our forces behind the wall. bar the gate. and set a watch on the surround. what of those who cannot fight, my lord? the women and children? get them into the caves. saruman\\'s arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here. helm\\'s deep has one weakness. its outer wall is solid rock  but for a small culvert at its base  which is little more than a drain. how? how can fire undo stone? what kind of device could bring down the wall? if the wall is breached, helm\\'s deep will fall. even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning  thousands, to storm the keep. tens of thousands. but, my lord, there is no such force. a new power is rising. its victory is at hand. this night  the land will be stained with the blood of rohan! march to helm\\'s deep! leave none alive! to war! there will be no dawn for men. look. there\\'s smoke to the south. there is always smoke rising  from isengard these days. isengard? there was a time  when saruman would walk in my woods. but now he has a mind of metal  and wheels. he no longer cares for growing things. what is it? it\\'s saruman\\'s army. the war has started. may the grace of the valar protect you. brego. arwen. it is time. the ships are leaving for valinor. go now before it is too late. i have made my choice. he is not coming back. why do you linger here when there is no hope? there is still hope. if aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted. if sauron is defeated and aragorn made king  and all that you hope for comes true  you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality. whether by the sword or the slow decay of time  aragorn will die. and there will be no comfort for you  no comfort to ease the pain of his passing. he will come to death  an image of the splendor of the kings of men  in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world. but you, my daughter  you will linger on in darkness and in doubt  as nightfall in winter that comes without a star. here you will dwell  bound to your grief under the fading trees  until all the world is changed  and the long years of your life are utterly spent. arwen. there is nothing for you here  only death. and i, do i not have your love? you have my love, father. the world is changed. i feel it in the water. i feel it in the earth, and i smell it in the air. the power of the enemy is growing. sauron will use his puppet, saruman  to destroy the people of rohan. isengard has been unleashed. the eye of sauron now turns to gondor  the last free kingdom of men. his war on this country will come swiftly. he senses the ring is close. the strength of the ring-bearer is failing. in his heart, frodo begins to understand  the quest will claim his life. you know this. you have foreseen it. it is the risk we all took. in the gathering dark, the will of the ring grows strong. it works hard now to find its way back into the hands of men. men, who are so easily seduced by its power. the young captain of gondor has but to extend his hand  take the ring for his own, and the world will fall. it is close now. so close to achieving its goal. for sauron will have dominion over all life on this earth  even unto to the ending of the world. the time of the elves  is over. do we leave middle-earth to its fate? do we let them stand alone? what news? our scouts report saruman has attacked rohan. theoden\\'s people have fled to helm\\'s deep. but we must look to our own borders. faramir, orcs are on the move. sauron is marshaling an army. easterlings and southrons are passing through the black gate. how many? some thousands. more come every day. who\\'s covering the river to the north? we pulled 500 men at osgiliath. if their city is attacked, we won\\'t hold it. saruman attacks from isengard. sauron from mordor. the fight will come to men on both fronts. gondor is weak. sauron will strike us soon. and he will strike hard. he knows now we do not have the strength to repel him. my men tell me that you are orc spies. spies? now wait just a minute. well, if you\\'re not spies, then who are you? speak. we are hobbits of the shire. frodo baggins is my name, and this is samwise gamgee. your bodyguard? his gardener. and where is your skulking friend? that gangrel creature. he had an ill-favored look. there was no other. we set out from rivendell with seven companions. one we lost in moria  two were my kin  a dwarf there was also. and an elf and two men. aragorn, son of arathorn, and boromir of gondor. you\\'re a friend of boromir? yes. for my part. it will grieve you then to learn that he is dead. dead? how? when? as one of his companions, i\\'d hoped you would tell me. if something has happened to boromir, we would have you tell us. his horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past. it was cloven in two. but more than this, i know it in my heart. he was my brother. boromir! boromir! this city was once the jewel of our kingdom. a place of light and beauty and music. and so it shall be once more! let the armies of mordor know this: never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands. this city of osgiliath has been reclaimed for gondor! for gondor! for gondor! for gondor! for gondor! good speech. nice and short. leaves more time for drinking! break out the ale! these men are thirsty! remember today, little brother. today, life is good. what? he\\'s here. one moment of peace, can he not give us that? where is he? where is gondor\\'s finest? where is my first-born? father! they say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handed. they exaggerate. the victory belongs to faramir also. but for faramir, this city would still be standing. were you not entrusted to protect it? i would have done, but our numbers were too few. oh, too few. you let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim. always you cast a poor reflection on me. that is not my intent. you give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will. he loves you, father. do not trouble me with faramir  i know his uses, and they are few. we have more urgent things to speak of. elrond of rivendell has called a meeting. he will not say why, but i have guessed its purpose. it is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found. the one ring. isildur\\'s bane. and it has fallen into the hands of the elves. everyone will try to claim it: men, dwarves, wizards. we cannot let that happen. this thing must come to gondor. gondor. it\\'s dangerous, i know. ever the ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser men. but you, you are strong. and our need is great. it is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying. sauron is biding his time. he\\'s massing fresh armies. he will return. and when he does, we will be powerless to stop him. you must go. bring me back this mighty gift. no. my place is here with my people. not in rivendell. would you deny your own father? if there is need to go to rivendell  send me in his stead. you? oh, i see. a chance for faramir, captain of gondor, to show his quality. i think not. i trust this mission only to your brother. the one who will not fail me. remember today, little brother. captain faramir! we found the third one. you must come with me. now. down there. to enter the forbidden pool bears the penalty of death. they wait for my command. shall i shoot? the rock and pool is nice and cool so juicy sweet our only wish to catch a fish so juicy sweet wait. this creature is bound to me. and i to him. he is our guide. please  let me go down to him. smeagol. master is here. come, smeagol. trust master. come. we must go now? smeagol, you must trust master. follow me. come on. come. come, smeagol. nice smeagol. that\\'s it. come on. don\\'t hurt him! smeagol, don\\'t struggle. smeagol, listen to me. master! that\\'s enough. where are you leading them? answer me. smeagol. why does it cry, smeagol? cruel men hurts us. master tricksed us. of course he did. i told you he was tricksy. i told you he was false. master is our friend. our friend. master betrayed us. no. not its business. leave us alone! filthy little hobbitses! they stole it from us! no. no. what did they steal? my precious! we have to get out of here. you go. go, now. you can do it. use the ring, mr. frodo. just this once. put it on. disappear. i can\\'t. you were right, sam. you tried to tell me but  i\\'m sorry. the ring\\'s taking me, sam. if i put it on  he\\'ll find me. he\\'ll see. mr. frodo  so this is the answer to all the riddles. here in the wild i have you  two halflings  and a host of men at my call. the ring of power within my grasp. a chance for faramir, captain of gondor  to show his quality. no! stop it! leave him alone. don\\'t you understand? he\\'s got to destroy it! that\\'s where we\\'re going, into mordor. to the mountain of fire! osgiliath is under attack. they call for reinforcements. please. it\\'s such a burden. will you not help him? captain? prepare to leave. the ring will go to gondor. well done, brego, my friend. he\\'s alive! where is he? where is he? get out of the way! i\\'m gonna kill him! you are the luckiest, the canniest  and the most reckless man i ever knew. bless you, laddie. gimli, where is the king? you\\'re late. you look terrible. thank you. a great host, you say? all isengard is emptied. how many? ten thousand strong at least. ten thousand? it is an army bred for a single purpose: to destroy the world of men. they will be here by nightfall. let them come! i want every man and strong lad able to bear arms  to be ready for battle by nightfall. we will cover the causeway and the gate from above. no army has ever breached the deeping wall  or set foot inside the hornburg! this is no rabble of mindless orcs. these are uruk-hai. their armor is thick and their shields broad. i have fought many wars, master dwarf. i know how to defend my own keep. they will break upon this fortress like water on rock. saruman\\'s hordes will pillage and burn. we\\'ve seen it before. crops can be resown  homes rebuilt. within these walls  we will outlast them. they do not come to destroy rohan\\'s crops or villages. they come to destroy its people  down to the last child. what would you have me do? look at my men. their courage hangs by a thread. if this is to be our end, then i would have them make such an end  as to be worthy of remembrance. send out riders, my lord. you must call for aid. and who will come? elves? dwarves? we are not so lucky in our friends as you. the old alliances are dead. gondor will answer. gondor?! where was gondor when the westfold fell?! where was gondor when our enemies closed in around us?! where was gon ? no, my lord aragorn  we are alone. get the women and children into the caves. we need more time to lay provisions  there is no time. war is upon us. secure the gate. we ents have not troubled  about the wars of men and wizards  for a very long time. but now, something is about to happen  that has not happened  for an age. entmoot. what\\'s that? \\'tis a gathering. a gathering of what? beech. oak. chestnut. ash. good. good. good. many have come. now we must decide if the ents  will go to war. move back! move to the caves! come on, people! quickly, now! we\\'ll place the reserves along the wall. they can support the archers from above the gate. aragorn, you must rest. you\\'re no use to us half alive. my lord! aragorn! i\\'m to be sent with the women into the caves. that is an honorable charge. to mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return. what renown is there in that? my lady, a time may come for valor without renown. who then will your people look to in the last defense? let me stand at your side. it is not in my power to command it. you do not command the others to stay! they fight beside you because they would not be parted from you. because they love you. i\\'m sorry. farmers, farriers, stable boys. these are no soldiers. most have seen too many winters. or too few. look at them. they\\'re frightened. i can see it in their eyes. and they should be three hundred… against ten thousand they have more hope of defending themselves here than at edoras aragorn, they cannot win this fight. they are all going to die! then i shall die as one of them! let him go, lad. let him be. every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory. my lord? who am i, gamling? you are our king, sire. and do you trust your king? your men, my lord  will follow you to whatever end. to whatever end. where is the horse and the rider? where is the horn that was blowing? they have passed like rain on the mountains. like wind in the meadow. the days have gone down in the west  behind the hills  into shadow. how did it come to this? it\\'s been going for hours. they must have decided something by now. decided? no. we only just finished saying  good morning. but it\\'s nighttime already. you can\\'t take forever. don\\'t be hasty. we\\'re running out of time! move! move to the outer wall. give me your sword. what is your name? haleth, son of hama, my lord. the men are saying that we will not live out the night. they say that it is hopeless. this is a good sword. haleth, son of hama  there is always hope. we have trusted you this far. you have not led us astray. forgive me. i was wrong to despair. there is nothing to forgive, legolas. we had time, i\\'d get this adjusted. it\\'s a little tight across the chest. that is no orc horn. send for the king. open the gate! open up the gate! how is this possible? i bring word from elrond of rivendell. an alliance once existed between elves and men. long ago we fought and died together. we come to honor that allegiance. well met, haldir! you are most welcome. we are proud to fight alongside men once more. you could have picked a better spot. well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let\\'s hope it lasts the night. your friends are with you, aragorn. let\\'s hope they last the night. o, children of eru  show them no mercy… for you shall receive none! what\\'s happening out there? shall i describe it to you? or would you like me to find you a box? hold! so it begins. prepare to fire! their armour is weak… at the throat  and beneath the arm. release arrows! did they hit anything? give them alley. fire! fire! send them to me! come on! ladders! good! swords! swords! legolas! two already! i\\'m on 17! i\\'ll have no pointy-ear outscoring me! nineteen! merry. we have just agreed. yes? i have told your names to the entmoot  and we have agreed  you are not orcs. well, that\\'s good news. and what about saruman? have you come to a decision about him? now, don\\'t be hasty, master meriadoc. hasty? our friends are out there. they need our help. they cannot fight this war on their own. war? yes. it affects us all. tree, root and twig. but you must understand, young hobbit  it takes a long time  to say anything in old entish  and we never say anything  unless it is worth taking  a long time to say. seventeen! eighteen! nineteen! twenty! twenty-one! causeway! towards the causeway! is this it? is this is all you can conjure, saruman? bring him down, legolas! kill him! kill him! brace the gate! hold them! stand firm! aragorn! gimli! hurl the arrows! charge! the ents cannot hold back this storm. we must weather such things as we have always done. how can that be your decision?! this is not our war. but you\\'re part of this world! aren\\'t you?! you must help. please. you must do something. you are young and brave, master merry. but your part in this tale is over. go back to your home. maybe treebeard\\'s right. we don\\'t belong here, merry. it\\'s too big for us. what can we do in the end? we\\'ve got the shire. maybe we should go home. the fires of isengard will spread  and the woods of tuckborough and buckland will burn. and  and all that was once green and good in this world will be gone. there won\\'t be a shire, pippin. aragorn! fall back to the keep! get your men out of there! to the keep! pull back! haldir! pull back! what are you doing? what are you stopping for? pull back! haldir! brace the gate! hold them! to the gate. draw your swords! make way! we cannot hold much longer! hold them!  how long do you need? as long as you can give me. gimli! timbers! brace the gate! come on. we can take \\'em. it\\'s a long way. toss me. what? i cannot jump the distance! you\\'ll have to toss me! don\\'t tell the elf. not a word. shore up the door! make way! follow me to the barricade. watch our backs! throw another one over here! higher! hold fast the gate! gimli! aragorn! get out of there! aragorn! pull everybody back. pull them back. fall back! fall back! they have broken through! the castle is breached. retreat! fall back! retreat! hurry! inside. get them inside! into the keep! i will leave you at the western borders of the forest. you can make your way north to your homeland from there. wait! stop! stop! turn around. turn around. take us south. south? but that will lead you past isengard. yes. exactly. if we go south, we can slip past saruman unnoticed. the closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm. it\\'s the last thing he\\'ll expect. that doesn\\'t make sense to me. but then  you are very small. perhaps you\\'re right. south it is, then. hold on, little shirelings. i always like going south. somehow it feels like going downhill. are you mad? we\\'ll be caught. no, we won\\'t. not this time. look! osgiliath burns! mordor has come. the ring will not save gondor. it has only the power to destroy. please  let me go. hurry. faramir! you must let me go! and those little family of field mice  that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully. they\\'re always trying to get somewhere where they  many of these trees were my friends. creatures i had known from nut and acorn. i\\'m sorry, treebeard. they hadices of their own. saruman. a wizard should know better! there is no curse in elvish  entish or the tongues of men  for this treachery. look! the trees! they\\'re moving! where are they going? they have business with the orcs. my business is with isengard tonight  with rock and stone. yes. come, my friends. the ents are going to war. it is likely  that we go to our doom. last march  of the ents. faramir! orcs have taken the eastern shore. their numbers are too great. by nightfall we will be overrun. mr. frodo? it\\'s calling to him, sam. his eye is almost on me. hold on, mr. frodo. you\\'ll be all right. take them to my father. tell him faramir sends a mighty gift. a weapon that will change our fortunes in this war. do you want to know what happened to boromir? you want to know why your brother died? he tried to take the ring from frodo after swearing an oath to protect him! he tried to kill him! the ring drove your brother mad! watch out! mr. frodo? they\\'re here. they\\'ve come. nazgul! stay here. keep out of sight. take cover! the fortress is taken. it is over. you said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it. they still defend it. they have died defending it. they\\'re breaking in! they\\'re past the door! is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves? is there no other way? there is one passage. it leads into the mountains. but they will not get far. the uruk-hai are too many. send word for the women and children to make for the mountain pass. and barricade the entrance! so much death. what can men do against such reckless hate? ride out with me. ride out and meet them. for death and glory. for rohan. for your people. the sun is rising. look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. at dawn  look to the east. yes. yes. the horn of helm hammerhand  shall sound in the deep  one last time. yes! let this be the hour when we draw swords together. fell deeds, awake. now for wrath  now for ruin and a red dawn. forth eorlingas! gandalf. theoden king stands alone. not alone. rohirrim! eomer. to the king! yes! a hit. a fine hit. break the dam! release the river! pippin! hold on! hold on, little hobbits. what are you doing? where are you going? it\\'s me. it\\'s your sam. don\\'t you know your sam? i can\\'t do this, sam. i know. it\\'s all wrong. by rights, we shouldn\\'t even be here. but we are. it\\'s like in the great stories, mr. frodo. the ones that really mattered. full of darkness and danger they were. and sometimes you didn\\'t want to know the end  because how could the end be happy? how could the world go back to the way it was  when so much bad had happened? victory! we have victory! but in the end, it\\'s only a passing thing  this shadow. even darkness must pass. a new day will come. and when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer. those were the stories that stayed with you  that meant something. even if you were too small to understand why. but i think, mr. frodo, i do understand. i know now. folk in those stories  had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn\\'t. they kept going  because they were holding on to something. what are we holding on to, sam? that there\\'s some good in this world, mr. frodo. and it\\'s worth fighting for. i think at last we understand one another, frodo baggins. you know the laws of our country, the laws of your father. if you let them go, your life will be forfeit. then it is forfeit. release them. stay out of the forest! keep away from the trees! final count  42 forty-two? oh, that\\'s not bad for a pointy-eared elvish princeling. i myself am sitting pretty on 43. forty-three. he was already dead. he was twitching. he was twitching  because he\\'s got my ax embedded in his nervous system! he doesn\\'t look too happy, does he? not too happy at all, merry. still, i suppose the view would be quite nice from up there. oh, yes. it\\'s a quality establishment. i hear the staff are very good. what are you doing? nothing. the world\\'s back to normal, that\\'s all. no, it isn\\'t. i\\'m starving. good luck trying to find something decent to eat around here. probably only dead rats and moldy bread. saruman\\'s storeroom! i don\\'t believe it. it can\\'t be. it is! longbottom leaf. the finest pipe-weed in the south farthing. it\\'s perfect. one barrel each. wait. do you think we should share it with treebeard? share it? no. no. dead plant and all that. don\\'t think he\\'d understand. could be a distant relative. oh, i get it. don\\'t be hasty. exactly. bar-hrum. this is the old sewer. runs right under the river through to the edge of the city. you\\'ll find cover in the woods there. captain faramir  you have shown your quality, sir. the very highest. the shire must truly be a great realm, master gamgee  where gardeners are held in high honor. what road will you take once you reach the woods? gollum says there\\'s a path  near minas morgul that climbs up into the mountains. cirith ungol? is that its name? no. no! yes. frodo  they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above minas morgul. you cannot go that way. it is the only way. master says we must go to mordor, so we must try. i must. go, frodo. go with the goodwill of all men. thank you. may death find you quickly if you bring them to harm. come on, keep up. mr. frodo didn\\'t mean for them rangers to hurt you. you know that, don\\'t you? he was trying to save you, see? save me? so there\\'s no hard feelings. forgive and forget. no, no, no hard feelings. gollum, gollum. yes, master. nice hobbits. very decent of you. very decent, indeed, gollum. sauron\\'s wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift. the battle for helm\\'s deep is over. the battle for middle-earth is about to begin. all our hopes now lie with two little hobbits  somewhere in the wilderness. i wonder if we\\'ll ever be put into songs or tales. what? i wonder if people will ever say, \"let\\'s hear about frodo and the ring.\" and they\\'ll say, \"yes! that\\'s one of my favorite stories.\" frodo was really courageous, wasn\\'t he, dad? yes, my boy. the most famousest of hobbits. and that\\'s saying a lot. well, you\\'ve left out one of the chief characters: samwise the brave. i want to hear more about sam. frodo wouldn\\'t have got far without sam. now, mr. frodo, you shouldn\\'t make fun. i was being serious. so was i. samwise the brave. smeagol? we\\'re not going to wait for you. come on. master. master looks after us. master wouldn\\'t hurt us. master broke his promise. don\\'t ask smeagol. poor, poor smeagol. master betrayed us. wicked. tricksy. false. we ought to wring his filthy little neck. kill him! kill him! kill them both! and then we take the precious  and we be the master! but the fat hobbit, he knows. eyes always watching. then we stabs them out. put out his eyeses and make him crawl. yes. yes. yes. kill them both. yes. no! no! it\\'s too risky. it\\'s too risky. where is he? where has he gone? hey, gollum! where are you? smeagol? we could let her do it. yes. she could do it. yes, precious, she could. and then we takes it once they\\'re dead. once they\\'re dead. come on, hobbits. long ways to go yet. smeagol will show you the way. follow me. sméagol! i\\'ve got one! i\\'ve got a fish, smeag. smeagol! pull it in. go on. go on. go on. pull it in. deagol! deagol? deagol. give us that, deagol, my love. why? because  it\\'s my birthday and i wants it. my precious. they cursed us. murderer. “murderer” they called us. they cursed us and drove us away. gollum. gollum. gollum. and we wept, precious. we wept to be so alone. and cool so nice for feet and we only wish to catch a fish so juicy sweet and we forgot the taste of bread  the sound of trees  the softness of the wind. we even forgot our own name. my precious. wake up! wake up! wake up, sleepies. we must go, yes. we must go at once. haven\\'t you had any sleep, mr. frodo? i\\'ve gone and had too much. must be getting late. no. it isn\\'t. it isn\\'t midday yet. the days are growing darker. come on! must go! no time! not before mr. frodo\\'s had something to eat. no time to lose, silly. here. what about you? oh, no, i\\'m not hungry. leastways, not for lembas bread. sam. all right. we don\\'t have that much left. we have to be careful or we\\'re going to run out. you go ahead and eat that, mr. frodo. i\\'ve rationed it. there should be enough. for what? the journey home. come, hobbitses. very close now. very close to mordor. no safe places here. hurry. it\\'s good. definitely from the shire. longbottom leaf. i feel like i\\'m back at the green dragon. green dragon. a mug of ale in my hand. putting my feet up on a settle after a hard day\\'s work. only, you\\'ve never done a hard day\\'s work. welcome, my lords  to isengard! you young rascals! a merry hunt you\\'ve led us on  and now we find you feasting and and smoking! we are sitting on a field of victory  enjoying a few well-earned comforts. the salted pork is particularly good. salted pork? hobbits. we\\'re under orders from treebeard  who\\'s taken over management of isengard. young master gandalf. i\\'m glad you\\'ve come. wood and water, stock and stone i can master. but there is a wizard to manage here  locked in his tower. show yourself. be careful. even in defeat, saruman is dangerous. well, let\\'s just have his head and be done with it. no. we need him alive. we need him to talk. you have fought many wars and slain many men, theoden king  and made peace afterwards. can we not take counsel together as we once did, my old friend? can we not have peace, you and i? we shall have peace. we shall have peace  when you answer for the burning of the westfold  and the children that lie dead there! we shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers  whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead  against the gates of the hornburg, are avenged! when you hang from a gibbet for the sport of your own crows  we shall have peace. gibbets and crows? dotard! what do you want, gandalf greyhame? let me guess. the key of orthanc. or perhaps the keys of barad-dur itself  along with the crowns of the seven kings and the rods of the five wizards! your treachery has already cost many lives. thousands more are now at risk. but you could save them, saruman. you were deep in the enemy\\'s counsel. so you have come here for information. i have some for you. something festers in the heart of middle-earth. something that you have failed to see. but the great eye has seen it. even now he presses his advantage. his attack will come soon. you\\'re all going to die. but you know this, don\\'t you, gandalf? you cannot think that this ranger will ever sit upon the throne of gondor. this exile, crept from the shadows, will never be crowned king. gandalf does not hesitate to sacrifice those closest to him  those he professes to love. tell me, what words of comfort did you give the halfling  before you sent him to his doom? the path that you have set him on can only lead to death. i\\'ve heard enough! shoot him. stick an arrow in his gob. no. come down, saruman  and your life will be spared. save your pity and your mercy. i have no use for it! saruman  your staff is broken. grima, you need not follow him. you were not always as you are now. you were once a man of rohan. come down. a man of rohan? what is the house of rohan  but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek  and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs? the victory at helm\\'s deep does not belong to you, theoden horse-master. you are a lesser son of greater sires. grima  come down. be free of him. free? he will never be free. no. get down, cur! saruman! you were deep in the enemy\\'s counsel. tell us what you know! you withdraw your guard, and i will tell you where your doom will be decided. i will not be held prisoner here. send word to all our allies  and to every corner of middle-earth that still stands free. the enemy moves against us. we need to know where he will strike. the filth of saruman  is washing away. trees will come back to live here. young trees. wild trees. pippin! bless my bark! peregrin took! i\\'ll take that, my lad. quickly, now. tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country. hail the victorious dead. hail! no pauses. no spills. and no regurgitation. so it\\'s a drinking game? last one standing wins. what\\'ll we drink to? let\\'s drink to victory! to victory! westu, aragorn, hal. i am happy for you. he is an honorable man. you are both honorable men. it was not theoden of rohan who led our people to victory. ah, don\\'t listen to me. you are young. and tonight is for you. here, here. it\\'s the dwarves that go swimming with little, hairy women. i feel something. a slight tingle in my fingers. i think it\\'s affecting me. what did i say? he can\\'t hold his liquor. game over. oh, you can search far and wide you can drink the whole town dry but you\\'ll never find a beer so brown but you\\'ll never find a beer so brown as the one we drink in our hometown/but you\\'ll never find a beer so brown as the one we drink in our hometown you can drink your fancy ales you can drink them by the flagon but the only brew for the brave and true pippin! but the only brew for the brave and true comes from the green dragon thank you! i win! no news of frodo? no word. nothing. we have time. every day, frodo moves closer to mordor. do we know that? what does your heart tell you? that frodo is alive. yes. yes, he\\'s alive. too risky. too risky. thieves. they stole it from us. kill them. kill them. kill them both. shh! quiet! mustn\\'t wake them. mustn\\'t ruin it now. but they knows. they knows. they suspects us. what\\'s it saying, my precious, my love? is smeagol losing his nerve? no. not. never. smeagol hates nasty hobbitses. smeagol wants to see them dead. and we will. smeagol did it once. he can do it again. it\\'s ours! ours! we must get the precious. we must get it back. patience! patience, my love. first we must lead them to her. we lead them to the winding stair. yes, the stairs. and then? up, up, up, up, up the stairs we go  until we come to the tunnel. and when they go in  there\\'s no coming out. she\\'s always hungry. she always needs to feed. she must eat. all she gets is filthy orcses. and they doesn\\'t taste very nice, does they, precious? no. not very nice at all, my love. she hungers for sweeter meats. hobbit meat. and when she throws away the bones and the empty clothes  then we will find it. and take it for me! for us. yes. we meant ”for us.” gollum. gollum. the precious will be ours  once the hobbitses are dead! you treacherous little toad! no! no! master! no, sam! leave him alone! i heard it from his own mouth. he means to murder us. never! smeagol wouldn\\'t hurt a fly. he\\'s a horrid, fat hobbit  who hates smeagol  and who makes up nasty lies. you miserable little maggot! i\\'ll stove your head in! sam! call me a liar? you\\'re a liar! you scare him off, we\\'re lost! i don\\'t care! i can\\'t do it, mr. frodo. i won\\'t wait around for him to kill us! i\\'m not sending him away. you don\\'t see it, do you? he\\'s a villain. we can\\'t do this by ourselves, sam. not without a guide. i need you on my side. i\\'m on your side, mr. frodo. i know, sam. i know. trust me. come, smeagol. what time is it? not yet dawn. i dreamed i saw a great wave  climbing over green lands and above the hills. i stood upon the brink. it was utterly dark in the abyss before my feet. a light shone behind me  but i could not turn. i could only stand there, waiting. night changes many thoughts. sleep, eowyn. sleep  while you can. the stars are veiled. something stirs in the east. a sleepless malice. the eye of the enemy is moving. what are you doing? pippin! pippin? pippin. are you mad? i just want to look at it. just one more time. put it back. pippin. no! pippin. he is here. i see you. pippin! help! gandalf, help! someone help him! pippin! fool of a took! look at me. gandalf, forgive me. look at me. what did you see? a tree. there was a white tree  in a courtyard of stone. it was dead. the city was burning. minas tirith? is that what you saw? i saw  i saw him. i could hear hisice in my head. and what did you tell him? speak! he asked me my name. i didn\\'t answer. he hurt me. what did you tell him about frodo and the ring? there was no lie in pippin\\'s eyes. a fool  but an honest fool he remains. he told sauron nothing of frodo and the ring. we\\'ve been strangely fortunate. pippin saw in the palantir a glimpse of the enemy\\'s plan. sauron moves to strike the city of minas tirith. his defeat at helm\\'s deep showed our enemy one thing. he knows the heir of elendil has come forth. men are not as weak as he supposed. there is courage still, strength enough perhaps to challenge him. sauron fears this. he will not risk the peoples of middle-earth uniting under one banner. he will raze minas tirith to the ground  before he sees a king return to the throne of men. if the beacons of gondor are lit, rohan must be ready for war. tell me  why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours? what do we owe gondor? i will go. no! they must be warned. they will be. you must come to minas tirith by another road. follow the river. look to the black ships. understand this: things are now in motion that cannot be undone. i ride for minas tirith  and i won\\'t be going alone. of all the inquisitive hobbits, peregrin took, you are the worst. hurry! hurry! where are we going? why did you look? why do you always have to look? i don\\'t know. i can\\'t help it. you never can. i\\'m sorry, all right? i won\\'t do it again. don\\'t you understand? the enemy thinks you have the ring. he\\'s going to be looking for you, pip. they have to get you out of here. and you ? you\\'re coming with me? merry? come on. how far is minas tirith? three days\\' ride, as the nazgul flies. and you better hope we don\\'t have one of those on our tail. here. something for the road. the last of the longbottom leaf. i know you\\'ve run out. you smoke too much, pip. but but we\\'ll see each other soon. won\\'t we? i don\\'t know. i don\\'t know what\\'s going to happen. merry. run, shadowfax. show us the meaning of haste. merry! merry! he\\'s always followed me  everywhere i went  since before we were tweens. i would get him into the worst sort of trouble  but i was always there to get him out. now he\\'s gone. just like frodo and sam. one thing i have learned about hobbits: they\\'re a most hardy folk. foolhardy, maybe. he\\'s a took. take her by the safest road. a ship lies anchored in the grey havens. it waits to carry her across the sea. the last journey of arwen undomiel. there is nothing for you here  only death. lady arwen  we cannot delay. my lady! tell me what you have seen. arwen. you have the gift of foresight. what did you see? i looked into your future, and i saw death. but there is also life. you saw there was a child. you saw my son. that future is almost gone. but it is not lost. nothing is certain. some things are certain. if i leave him now  i will regret it forever. it is time. from the ashes a fire shall be woken a light from the shadow shall spring renewed shall be blade that was broken the crownless again shall be king re-forge the sword. ada. your hands are cold. the life of the eldar is leaving you. this was my choice. ada, whether by your will or not  there is no ship now that can bear me hence. we\\'ve just passed into the realm of gondor. minas tirith. city of kings. make way! it\\'s the tree. gandalf. gandalf. yes, the white tree of gondor. the tree of the king. lord denethor, however, is not king. he is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne. now listen carefully. lord denethor is boromir\\'s father. to give him news of his beloved son\\'s death would be most unwise. and do not mention frodo or the ring. and say nothing of aragorn either. in fact, it\\'s better if you don\\'t speak at all, peregrin took. hail denethor, son of ecthelion, lord and steward of gondor. i come with tidings in this dark hour, and with counsel. perhaps you come to explain this. perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead. boromir died to save us  my kinsman and me. he fell defending us from many foes. pippin. i offer you my service, such as it is  in payment of this debt. this is my first command to you. how did you escape and my son did not  so mighty a man as he was? the mightiest man may be slain by one arrow  and boromir was pierced by many. get up. my lord, there will be a time to grieve for boromir  but it is not now. war is coming. the enemy is on your doorstep. as steward, you are charged  with the defense of this city. where are gondor\\'s armies? you still have friends. you are not alone in this fight. send word to theoden of rohan. light the beacons. you think you are wise, mithrandir. yet for all your subtleties, you have not wisdom. do you think the eyes of the white tower are blind? i have seen more than you know. with your left hand you would use me as a shield against mordor. and with your right you\\'d seek to supplant me. i know who rides with theoden of rohan. oh, yes. word has reached my ears of this aragorn, son of arathorn. and i tell you now, i will not bow to this ranger from the north  last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship. authority is not given to you to deny the return of the king, steward. the rule of gondor is mine and no other\\'s. come. all has turned to vain ambition. he would even use his grief as a cloak. a thousand years this city has stood. now, at the whim of a madman, it will fall. and the white tree, the tree of the king  will never bloom again. why are they still guarding it? they guard it because they have hope. a faint and fading hope that one day it will flower. that a king will come and this city will be as it once was  before it fell into decay. the old wisdom borne out of the west was forsaken. kings made tombs more splendid than the houses of the living  and counted the old names of their descent  dearer than the names of their sons. childless lords sat in aged halls, musing on heraldry  or in high, cold towers, asking questions of the stars. and so the people of gondor fell into ruin. the line of kings failed. the white tree withered. the rule of gondor was given over to lesser men. mordor. yes, there it lies. this city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow. a storm is coming. this is not the weather of the world. this is a device of sauron\\'s making. a broil of fume he sends ahead of his host. the orcs of mordor have no love of daylight  so he covers the face of the sun  to ease their passage along the road to war. when the shadow of mordor reaches this city  it will begin. well  minas tirith  very impressive. so where are we off to next? oh, it\\'s too late for that, peregrin. there\\'s no leaving this city. help must come to us. it must be getting near teatime. leastways, it would be in decent places where there is still teatime. we\\'re not in decent places. mr. frodo? what is it? it\\'s just a feeling. i don\\'t think i\\'ll be coming back. yes, you will. of course you will. that\\'s just morbid thinking. we\\'re going there and back again  just like mr. bilbo. you\\'ll see. i think these lands were once part of the kingdom of gondor. long ago, when there was a king. mr. frodo, look. the king has got a crown again. come on, hobbits! mustn\\'t stop now. this way. so i imagine this is just a ceremonial position. i mean, they don\\'t actually expect me to do any fighting. do they? you\\'re in the service of the steward now. you\\'ll have to do as you\\'re told, peregrin took. ridiculous hobbit. guard of the citadel. thank you. there\\'s no more stars. is it time? yes. it\\'s so quiet. it\\'s the deep breath before the plunge. i don\\'t want to be in a battle  but waiting on the edge of one i can\\'t escape is even worse. is there any hope, gandalf, for frodo and sam? there never was much hope. just a fool\\'s hope. our enemy is ready. his full strength\\'s gathered. not only orcs, but men as well. legions of haradrim from the south  mercenaries from the coast. all will answer mordor\\'s call. come on. this will be the end of gondor as we know it. here the hammer stroke will fall hardest. if the river is taken, if the garrison at osgiliath falls  the last defense of this city will be gone. but we have the white wizard. that\\'s got to count for something. gandalf? sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant  the one who will lead mordor\\'s armies in war. the one they say no living man can kill. the witch king of angmar. you\\'ve met him before. he stabbed frodo on weathertop. he is the lord of the nazgul  the greatest of the nine. minas morgul is his lair. the dead city. very nasty place. full of enemies. quick. quick. they will see. they will see. come away. come away. look, we have found it. the way into mordor. the secret stair. climb. no, mr. frodo! not that way! what\\'s it doing? no. they\\'re calling me. no. hide! hide! i can feel his blade. we come to it at last. the great battle of our time. come away, hobbits. we climb. we must climb. the board is set. the pieces are moving. up, up, up the stairs we go. and then it\\'s into the tunnel. hey, what\\'s in this tunnel? you listen to me, and you listen good and proper. anything happens to him, you have me to answer to. one sniff something\\'s not right  one hair stands up on the back of my head, it\\'s over. no more slinker. no more stinker. you\\'re gone. got it? i\\'m watching you. what was that about? nothing. just clearing something up. peregrin took, my lad, there is a task now to be done. another opportunity for one of the shire-folk to prove their great worth. you must not fail me. it\\'s been very quiet across the river. the orcs are lying low. the garrison may have moved out. we\\'ve sent scouts to cair andros. if the orcs attack from the north, we\\'ll have some warning. quiet. we need 10 more. kill him! they\\'re not coming from the north. to the river. quick. quick. go. come on. faster. draw swords. hold! hold them! what? amon din the beacon. the beacon of amon din is lit. hope is kindled. the beacons of minas tirith! the beacons are lit! gondor calls for aid. and rohan will answer. muster the rohirrim. assemble the army at dunharrow. as many men as can be found. you have two days. on the third, we ride for gondor and war. forward. very good, sir. gamling. my lord. make haste across the riddermark. summon every able-bodied man to dunharrow. i will. will you ride with us? just to the encampment. it\\'s tradition for the women of the court to farewell the men. the men have found their captain. they will follow you into battle, even to death. you have given us hope. excuse me. i have a sword. please accept it. i offer you my service, theoden king. and gladly i accept it. you shall be meriadoc, esquire of rohan. horse-men. i wish i could muster a legion of dwarves, fully armed and filthy. your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war. i fear war already marches on their own lands. so it is before the walls of minas tirith  the doom of our time will be decided. now is the hour. riders of rohan, oaths you have taken. now, fulfill them all. to lord and land! ya! faramir! we can\\'t hold them. the city is lost. tell the men to break cover. we ride for minas tirith. nazgul. take cover! nazgul! fall back. fall back to minas tirith! fall back! retreat! retreat! run for your lives! the age of men is over. the time of the orc has come. keep going. it\\'s the nazgul. take cover, my lord! it\\'s coming! it\\'s mithrandir. the white rider! pull! mithrandir. they broke through our defenses. they\\'ve taken the bridge and the west bank. battalions of orcs are crossing the river. it is as the lord denethor predicted. long has he foreseen this doom. foreseen and done nothing. faramir? this is not the first halfling to have crossed your path. no. you\\'ve seen frodo and sam? where? when? in ithilien. not two days ago. gandalf, they\\'re taking the road to the morgul vale. and then the pass of cirith ungol. what does that mean? what\\'s wrong? faramir, tell me everything. tell me all you know. this is how you would serve your city? you would risk its utter ruin? i did what i judged to be right. what you judged to be right. you sent the ring of power into mordor in the hands of a witless halfling. it should have been brought back to the citadel to be kept safe. hidden. dark and deep in the vaults  not to be used. unless at the uttermost end of need. i would not use the ring. not if minas tirith were falling in ruin and i alone could save her. ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious  as a king of old. boromir would have remembered his father\\'s need. he would have brought me a kingly gift. boromir would not have brought the ring. he would have stretched out his hand to this thing and taken it. he would\\'ve fallen. you know nothing of this matter! he would have kept it for his own. and when he returned  you would not have known your son. boromir was loyal to me! not some wizard\\'s pupil! father? my son. leave me. careful, master. careful. very far to fall. very dangerous are the stairs. come, master. come to smeagol. mr. frodo. get back, you! don\\'t touch him! why does he hates poor smeagol? what has smeagol ever done to him? master? master carries heavy burden. smeagol knows. heavy, heavy burden. fat one cannot know. smeagol look after master. he wants it. he needs it. smeagol sees it in his eye. very soon he will ask you for it. you will see. the fat one will take it from you. send forth all legions. do not stop the attack until the city is taken. slay them all. what of the wizard? i will break him. where are theoden\\'s riders? will rohan\\'s army come? mithrandir. courage is the best defense that you have now. what were you thinking, peregrin took? what service can a hobbit offer such a great lord of men? it was well-done. a generous deed should not be checked with cold counsel. you are to join the tower guard. i didn\\'t think they would find any livery that would fit me. it once belonged to a young boy of the city. a very foolish one  who wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending to his studies. this was yours? yes, it was mine. my father had it made for me. well  i\\'m taller than you were then. though i\\'m not likely to grow anymore, except sideways. never fitted me either. boromir was always the soldier. they were so alike, he and my father. proud. stubborn even. but strong. i think you have strength of a different kind. and one day your father will see it. here do i swear fealty and service to gondor  in peace or war  in living or dying  from  from this hour henceforth  until my lord release me  or death take me. and i shall not forget it  nor fail to reward that which is given. fealty with love. valor with honor. disloyalty with vengeance. i do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defenses  defenses that your brother long held intact. what would you have me do? i will not yield  the river in pelennor unfought. osgiliath must be retaken. my lord, osgiliath is overrun. much must be risked in war. is there a captain here who still has the courage to do his lord\\'s will? you wish now that our places had been exchanged  that i had died and boromir had lived. yes. i wish that. since you were robbed of boromir  i will do what i can in his stead. if i should return, think better of me, father. that will depend on the manner of your return. what are you up to? sneaking off, are we? sneaking? sneaking? fat hobbit is always so polite. smeagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find  and they say “sneak.” sneak? very nice friend. oh, yes, my precious. very nice, very nice. all right. all right! you just startled me is all. what were you doing? sneaking. fine. have it your own way. i\\'m sorry to wake you, mr. frodo. we have to be moving on. it\\'s dark still. it\\'s always dark here. it\\'s gone! the elven bread. what? that\\'s all we have left. he took it. he must have! smeagol? no, no, not poor smeagol. smeagol hates nasty elf bread. you\\'re a lying rat! what did you do with it?! he doesn\\'t eat it. he can\\'t have taken it. look. what\\'s this? crumbs on his jacketses. he took it! he took it. i seen him. he\\'s always stuffing his face when master\\'s not looking. that\\'s a filthy lie! you stinking, two-faced sneak! sam! call me  stop it! sam! i\\'ll kill him! sam! no! oh, my i\\'m sorry. i didn\\'t mean it to go so far. i was just so so angry. here, just let\\'s just rest a bit. i\\'m all right. no. no, you\\'re not all right. you\\'re exhausted. it\\'s that gollum. it\\'s this place. it\\'s that thing around your neck. i could help a bit. i could carry it for a while. carry it for a while. i could carry it i could carry it. share the load share the load the load the load. get away! i don\\'t want to keep it. i just want to help. see? see? he wants it for himself. shut up, you! go away! get out of here! no, sam. it\\'s you. i\\'m sorry, sam. but he\\'s a liar. he\\'s poisoned you against me. you can\\'t help me anymore. you don\\'t mean that. go home. faramir! faramir! your father\\'s will has turned to madness. do not throw away your life so rashly. where does my allegiance lie if not here? this is the city of the men of numenor. i will gladly give my life to defend her beauty  her memory, her wisdom. your father loves you, faramir. he will remember it before the end. can you sing, master hobbit? well  yes. at least, well enough for my own people. but we have no songs for great halls  and evil times. and why should your songs be unfit for my halls? come, sing me a song. home is behind the world ahead and there are many paths to tread through shadow to the edge of night until the stars are all alight mist and shadow cloud and shade all shall fade all shall fade march! march! march! march! march! make way for the king. make way. the king is here. my lord. hail to you, sire. grimbold, how many? i bring 500 men from the westfold, my lord. we have 300 more from fenmarch, theoden king. where are the riders from snowborn? none have come, my lord. six thousand spears. less than half of what i\\'d hoped for. six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of mordor. more will come. every hour lost hastens gondor\\'s defeat. we have till dawn, then we must ride. the horses are restless  and the men are quiet. they grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain. that road there  where does that lead? it is the road to the dimholt, the door under the mountain. none who venture there ever return. that mountain is evil. aragorn. let\\'s find some food. there. a true esquire of rohan. i\\'m ready. sorry. it isn\\'t all that dangerous. it\\'s not even sharp. well, that\\'s no good. you won\\'t kill many orcs with a blunt blade. come on. to the smithy. go! you should not encourage him. you should not doubt him. i do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm. why should merry be left behind? he has as much cause to go to war as you. why can he not fight for those he loves? you know as little of war as that hobbit. when the fear takes him  and the blood and the screams and the horror of battle take hold  do you think he would stand and fight? he would flee. and he would be right to do so. war is the province of men, eowyn. i choose a mortal life. i wish i could\\'ve seen him  one last time. sir? king theoden awaits you, my lord. i take my leave. my lord elrond. i come on behalf of one whom i love. arwen is dying. she will not long survive the evil that now spreads from mordor. the light of the evenstar is failing. as sauron\\'s power grows, her strength wanes. arwen\\'s life is now tied to the fate of the ring. the shadow is upon us, aragorn. the end has come. it will not be our end, but his. you ride to war, but not to victory. sauron\\'s armies march on minas tirith, this you know. but in secret he sends another force which will attack from the river. a fleet of corsair ships sails from the south. they\\'ll be in the city in two days. you\\'re outnumbered, aragorn. you need more men. there are none. there are those who dwell in the mountain. murderers  traitors. you would call upon them to fight? they believe in nothing. they answer to no one. they will answer to the king of gondor. anduril, the flame of the west, forged from the shards of narsil. sauron will not have forgotten the sword of elendil. the blade that was broken shall return to minas tirith. the man who can wield the power of this sword  can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth. put aside the ranger. become who you were born to be. take the dimholt road. i give hope to men. i keep none for myself. why are you doing this? the war lies to the east. you cannot leave on the eve of battle. you cannot abandon the men. eowyn  we need you here. why have you come? do you not know? it is but a shadow and a thought that you love. i cannot give you what you seek. i have wished you joy since first i saw you. just where do you think you\\'re off to? not this time. this time you must stay, gimli. have you learned nothing of the stubbornness of dwarves? you might as well accept it. we\\'re going with you, laddie. what\\'s happening?  where is he going? where\\'s he going? i don\\'t understand. lord aragorn! why does he leave on the eve of battle? he leaves because there is no hope. he leaves because he must. too few have come. we cannot defeat the armies of mordor. no  we cannot. but we will meet them in battle nonetheless. i have left instruction. the people are to follow your rule in my stead. take up my seat in the golden hall. long may you defend edoras  if the battle goes ill. what other duty would you have me do, my lord? duty? no. i would have you smile again  not grieve for those whose time has come. you shall live to see these days renewed  and no more despair. what kind of army would linger in such a place? one that is cursed. long ago, the men of the mountains swore an oath  to the last king of gondor  to come to his aid  to fight. but when the time came  when gondor\\'s need was dire  they fled  vanishing into the darkness of the mountain. and so isildur cursed them  never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge. who shall call them from the grey twilight? the forgotten people. the heir of him to whom the oath they swore. from the north shall he come. need shall drive him. he shall pass the door to the paths of the dead. the very warmth of my blood seems stolen away. the way is shut. it was made by those who are dead. and the dead keep it. the way is shut. brego! i do not fear death. well, this is a thing unheard-of. an elf will go underground where a dwarf dare not? oh. oh, i\\'d never hear the end of it. we must ride light and swift. it is a long road ahead. and man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight. little hobbits do not belong in war, master meriadoc. all my friends have gone to battle. i would be ashamed to be left behind. it is a three-day gallop to minas tirith. and none of my riders can bear you as a burden. i want to fight. i will say no more. ride with me. my lady. form up! move out! form up! move out! ride! ride now to gondor! what is it? what do you see? i see shapes of men. and of horses. where? pale banners like shreds of cloud. spears rise  like winter-thickets through a shroud of mist. the dead are following. they have been summoned. the dead? summoned? i knew that. very good. very good! legolas! do not look down. who enters my domain? one who will have your allegiance. the dead do not suffer the living to pass. you will suffer me. the way is shut. it was made by those who are dead. and the dead keep it. the way is shut. now you must die. i summon you to fulfill your oath. none but the king of gondor may command me. that line was broken. it has been remade. fight for us  and regain your honor. what say you? what say you? you waste your time, aragorn. they had no honor in life, they have none now in death. i am isildur\\'s heir. fight for me  and i will hold your oaths fulfilled. what say you? you have my word! fight, and i will release you from this living death! what say you?! stand, you traitors! out! legolas! run! we fight. open the gate! quick! quick! hurry! faramir! say not that he has fallen. they were outnumbered. none survived. fear. the city is rank with it. let us ease their pain. release the prisoners. catapults! my sons are spent. my line has ended. he\\'s alive! the house of stewards has failed. he needs medicine, my lord. my line has ended! my lord! rohan  has deserted us. theoden\\'s betrayed me. abandon your posts! flee! flee for your lives! prepare for battle! hurry, men! to the wall! defend the wall! over here! return to your posts! send these foul beasts into the abyss. stay where you are. we need more rubble! watch out! down to the lower levels. quick! double up, men! hold them back! do not give in to fear. stand to your posts! fight! not at the towers! aim for the trolls! kill the trolls! bring them down! fight them back! peregrin took! go back to the citadel! they\\'d called us out to fight. this is no place for a hobbit. guard of the citadel, indeed. now, back, up the hill. quickly. quick! what are you doing, you useless scum?! the door won\\'t give. it\\'s too strong. get back there and smash it down. but nothing can breach it. grond will breach it. bring up the wolf\\'s head. grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! grond! you may go no further. you will not enter gondor. who are you to deny us passage? legolas, fire a warning shot past the bosun\\'s ear. mind your aim. that\\'s it. right. we warned you. prepare to be boarded. boarded? by you and whose army? this army. in there. what is this place? master must go inside the tunnel. now that i\\'m here,

end here. death is just another path  one that we all must take. the grey rain curtain of this world rolls back  and all turns to silver glass. and then you see it. what, gandalf? see what? white shores  and beyond. a far green country  under a swift sunrise. well  that isn\\'t so bad. no. no, it isn\\'t. rally to me! to me! feast on his flesh. i will kill you if you touch him. do not come

everything else. i don\\'t take orders from stinking morgul-rats! you touch it, and i\\'ll stick this blade in your gut. the scum tried to knife me. kill him! that\\'s for frodo! and for the shire! and that\\'s for my old gaffer! stop your squealing, you dunghill rat. i\\'m gonna bleed you like a stuck pig. not if i stick you first. sam! oh, sam, i\\'m so sorry. sorry for everything. let\\'s get you out of here. it\\'s too late. it\\'s over. they\\'ve taken it. sam  they took the ring. begging your pardon, but they haven\\'t. i thought i\\'d lost you. so i took it. only for safekeeping. give it to me. give me the ring, sam. sam. give me the ring. you must understand. the ring is my burden. it will destroy you, sam. come on, mr. frodo. we best find you some clothes. you can\\'t go walking through mordor in naught but your skin. we did it, mr. frodo. we made it to mordor. there are so many of them. we\\'ll never get through unseen. it\\'s him, the eye. we have to go in there, mr. frodo. there\\'s nothing for it. come on. let\\'s just make it down the hill for starters. frodo has passed beyond my sight. the darkness is deepening. if sauron had the ring, we would know it. it\\'s only a matter of time. he has suffered a defeat, yes but  behind the walls of mordor, our enemy is regrouping. let him stay there. let him rot! why should we care? because 10,000 orcs now stand between frodo and mount doom. i\\'ve sent him to his death. no. there is still hope for frodo. he needs time and safe passage across the plains of gorgoroth. we can give him that. how? draw out sauron\\'s armies. empty his lands. then we gather our full strength and march on the black gate. we cannot achieve victory through strength of arms. not for ourselves. but we can give frodo his chance if we keep sauron\\'s eye fixed upon us. keep him blind to all else that moves. a diversion. certainty of death  small chance of success  what are we waiting for? sauron will suspect a trap. he will not take the bait. oh, i think he will. long have you hunted me. long have i eluded you. no more. behold the sword of elendil. the city has fallen silent. there is no warmth left in the sun. it grows so cold. it\\'s just the damp of the first spring rain. i do not believe this darkness will endure. look, the orcs  they\\'re moving off. you see, mr. frodo  some luck at last. move it, you slugs! come on! faster! come along, you coldhearted wretched scum  i\\'ll whip you down to the bone, you  come on! what have i told you? no evasion. now move it! get up! come on, you slugs! you two are going straight to the front line! now, move it! go on! fall in! move it! move it! move it! to the gate, you slugs! now, move it! faster! don\\'t you know we\\'re at war? company, halt! inspection! sam, help me. mr. frodo! stand up, mr. frodo. stand up! it\\'s so heavy. oh, no. what do i do? what do we do? hit me. what? hit me, sam. start fighting. get off of me! nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot. get off of me! break it up! break it up! oi! i\\'ll have your guts if you don\\'t shut this rabble down! go, sam. now! move along, scum! back in the line! you maggots! get back into the line, you slugs! dig it, you slugs. move it. i can\\'t  i can\\'t i can\\'t manage the ring, sam. it\\'s it\\'s  it\\'s such a weight to carry. it\\'s  such a weight. we\\'re going that way. straight as we can. there\\'s no point carrying anything we\\'re not sure to need. mr. frodo. look. there is light  and beauty up there  that no shadow can touch. take mine. there\\'s a few drops left. there will be none left for the return journey. i don\\'t think there will be a return journey, mr. frodo. frodo, get down! hide! frodo! where are they? let the lord of the black land come forth! let justice be done upon him! my master, sauron the great, bids thee welcome. is there any in this rout with authority to treat with me? we do not come to treat with sauron  faithless and accursed. tell your master this: the armies of mordor must disband. he is to depart these lands, never to return. old greybeard. i have a token i was bidden to show thee. frodo. frodo. silence. no! silence! the halfling was dear to thee, i see. know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host. who would\\'ve thought one so small could endure so much pain? and he did, gandalf. he did. and who is this? isildur\\'s heir? it takes more to make a king than a broken elvish blade. i guess that concludes negotiations. i do not believe it. i will not. pull back. pull back! it\\'s gone, mr. frodo. the light\\'s passed on, away towards the north. something\\'s drawn its gaze. hold your ground! hold your ground. sons of gondor, of rohan, my brothers! i see in your eyes  the same fear that would take the heart of me. a day may come when the courage of men fails  when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship. but it is not this day. an hour of wolves and shattered shields  when the age of men comes crashing down. but it is not this day. this day we fight! by all that you hold dear on this good earth  i bid you stand, men of the west! never thought i\\'d die fighting side by side with an elf. what about side by side with a friend? aye. i could do that. do you remember the shire, mr. frodo? it\\'ll be spring soon. and the orchards will be in blossom. and the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket. and they\\'ll be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields  and eating the first of the strawberries with cream. do you remember the taste of strawberries? no, sam. i can\\'t recall the taste of food  nor the sound of water  nor the touch of grass. i\\'m  naked in the dark. there\\'s there\\'s nothing. no veil between me and the wheel of fire. i can see him  with my waking eyes. then let us be rid of it  once and for all. come on, mr. frodo. i can\\'t carry it for you  but i can carry you. come on! aragorn. elessar. for frodo. look, mr. frodo. a doorway. we\\'re almost there. clever hobbits to climb so high! mustn\\'t go that way. mustn\\'t hurt the precious. you swore! you swore on the precious! smeagol promised! smeagol lied. frodo! eagles. the eagles are coming! frodo! i\\'m here, sam. destroy it! go on! now! throw it in the fire! what are you waiting for? just let it go! the ring is mine. no. no. no! yes! yes! precious! precious! precious! precious! give me your hand! take my hand! no! don\\'t you let go. don\\'t let go. reach! frodo! frodo! it\\'s gone. it\\'s done. yes, mr. frodo. it\\'s over now. i can see the shire. the brandywine river. bag end. gandalf\\'s fireworks. the lights in the party tree. rosie cotton dancing. she had ribbons in her hair. if ever i was to marry someone  it would\\'ve been her. it would\\'ve been her. i\\'m glad to be with you, samwise gamgee  here at the end of all things. gandalf? frodo! gimli! now come the days of the king. may they be blessed. this day does not belong to one man  but to all. let us together rebuild this world  that we may share in the days of peace. out of the great sea  to middle-earth i am come. in this place will i abide  and my heirs  unto the ending of the world. thank you. my friends  you bow to no one. and thus it was. a fourth age of middle-earth began. and the fellowship of the ring  though eternally bound by friendship and love  was ended. thirteen months to the day since gandalf sent us on our long journey  we found ourselves looking upon a familiar sight. we were home. hi. hey, watch the pumpkin. more of the same, rosie. good night, lads. how do you pick up the threads of an old life? how do you go on  when in your heart you begin to understand  there is no going back? there are some things that time cannot mend  some hurts that go too deep  that have taken hold. mr. frodo? what is it? it\\'s been four years to the day since weathertop, sam. it\\'s never really healed. “there and back again. a hobbit\\'s tale by bilbo baggins. and the lord of the rings by frodo baggins.\" you finished it. not quite. there\\'s room for a little more. bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end  that each of us must come and go in the telling. bilbo\\'s story was now over. there would be no more journeys for him  save one. tell me again, lad, where are we going? to the harbor, bilbo. the elves have accorded you a special honor  a place on the last ship to leave middle-earth. frodo  any chance of seeing that old ring of mine again? the one i gave you. i\\'m sorry, uncle. i\\'m afraid i lost it. oh. pity. i should like to have held it one last time. well, here\\'s a sight i have never seen before. the power of the three rings is ended. the time has come  for the dominion of men. the sea calls us home. i think i\\'m  quite ready for another adventure. farewell  my brave hobbits. my work is now finished. here at last, on the shores of the sea  comes the end of our fellowship. i will not say, “do not weep”  for not all tears are an evil. it is time, frodo. what does he mean? we set out to save the shire, sam. and it has been saved. but not for me. you don\\'t mean that. you can\\'t leave. the last pages are for you, sam. my dear sam: you cannot always be torn in two. you will have to be one and whole for many years. you have so much to enjoy and to be and to do. your part in the story will go on. well  i\\'m back.black continues elvish singing a woman\\'s voice is whispering, tinged with sadness and regret flickering firelight. the noldorin forge in eregion. molten gold pours from the lip of an iron ladle. three rings, each set with a single gem, are received by the high elves-galadriel, gil-galad and cirdan. seven rings held aloft in triumph by the dwarf lords. nine rings clutched tightly by the kings of men as if holding-close a precious secret. an ancient parchment map of middle earth moving slowly across the map as if drawn by an unseen force the camera closes in on a place name mordor. sauron forging the one ring in the chambers of sammath naur. the one ring falls through space and into flames. a great shadow falls across the map closing in around the realm of gondor. screaming villagers, men, women, and children, run from their homes, pursued by armies of hideous orcs. the battle of dagorlad the elf lord, elrond, commands rank after rank of elven archers orcs retreating before the army of the last alliance elendil holds aloft the great sword narsil. the huge, dark figure of saruron, bearing the one ring on his finger, looms over the field of battle. sauron lays waste to the armies of the last alliance. with desperate courage, elendil leads a charge the black mace of sauron lashes out elendil\\'s body falls like a crumpled rag doll isildur cradles the body of his father in his arms. the shadow of sauron falls over him. isildur snatches up the broken blade of narsil the blade severs sauron\\'s fingers and the one ring flies from his body. gone vaporized. isildur picks up the severed finger and removes the one ring transfixed. suddenly. arrows fly. they are ambushed by orcs isildur screams. isildur materializes under water as the ring slips slowly from his finger. ripples of light play across isildur\\'s pale face he is dead. the ring falls through the murky waters of the river anduin. the waters of the anduin river lie dark and undisturbed. silt swirls a thin white hand reaches down grasping the ring. the thin white hand opens to reveal one ring. mist shrouded mountains. the gloom of a mountain cavern a murky pool of water in the darkness the shadowy outline of an emaciated figure. bathed in cold moonlight, the world lies dark and still the unsettled quiet before the storm. unseen by its keeper the ring falls to the muddy floor of a mountain tunnel. fumbling in the dark, a small hand closes over the ring. a youngish looking bilbo baggins peers down at what lies in his hand perplexed by what he has found. suddenly. a voice screams its anguish ringing through the cold, dank tunnels. frightened bilbo quickly pockets the one ring and hurries on. the camera soars away from the mountains. moving faster and faster their dark green forests and jagged white peaks receding into the shroud of mist two hobbit feet resting on a small rock rising out of the long, overgrown grasses a figure lies beneath the dappled sunlight of an old tree. white flowers are scattered among the well seeded grasses. an idyllic setting at the end of a long hot summer the figure is reading a book. in the distance, growing louder over the gentle clip clop of an approaching cart and horse can be heard the humming of a deep voice to the tune of \"the road goes ever on and on \" suddenly. the figure in the grass sits up looking straight at camera is a handsome young hobbit, with dark curly hair and deep blue eyes. this is frodo baggins his eyes alight with excitement. tossing away the long stem of grass in his mouth, frodo runs off. the cart rattles along a leafy lane, driven by a stooped figure in grey. intercut with shots of frodo running careering down a hill jumping over logs dodging tree branches. the shambling old pony snorts and rears as suddenly frodo appears on a bank above the cart. gandalf glowers at the young hobbit. they look at each other a moment then both start laughing as frodo\\'s face breaks into a smile and he leaps on to the front seat of the cart. next to gandalf, we see how small hobbits are frodo is 3 foot 6 inches tall. the cart rattles past a field lupin being tended by hobbits. gandalf looks down at frodo, a twinkle in his eye. the cart rattles over a stone bridge towards a busy hobbit marketplace. gandalf as he surveys the peaceful scene before him. hobbits look up exclaiming in wonder and excitement as the cart bearing gandalf and frodo rolls past the green dragon inn towards the party field. where scorcs of hobbits are busy preparing for the big night. frodo shoots a knowing look, as gandalf averts his eyes. odo proudfoot looks up as the cart passes by, deeply suspicious. as the cart rattles into the small village of hobbiton a quaint rustic settlement, nestled amongst rolling green hills and large trees. the hobbits live in hobbit holes neat burrows dug into the grassy hillside, with round doors and cute front gardens. excited children, chasing after the cart. gandalf ignorcs the children\\'s cries. the children stand deflated, watching gandalf disappear up the lane. at that moment spinning balls of bright color suddenly leap out of the cart, fizzing over the heads of the delighted children. gandalf smiling to himself, well pleased with his joke. odo proudfoot is unable to suppress a chuckle. frodo stands up in the cart as gandalf reigns in the horse. gandalf\\'s cart pulls up outside the gate to bag end a particularly fine example of a hobbit hole, with a large round front door set into a grassy hillside. there is a sign on the gate which reads \"no admittance except on party business.\" gandalf strides up to the garden path of bag end. he raises his staff and raps on the front door a voice calls out suddenly the door opens and bilbo baggins stands before him. he is a hobbit of indertiminate age, with a mischievous twinkle in his eye. wearing a dashing brocade waist coat, he looks every inch the eccentric gentleman. gandalf drops to his knee to embrace his old friend. gandalf looks at him more keenly. bilbo leads gandalf into bag end cozy and cluttered with souvenirs of bilbo\\'s travels. gandalf has to stoop to avoid hitting his head on the low ceiling. bilbo hangs up gandalf\\'s hat on a peg and trots off down the hall. bilbo disappears into the kitchen as gandalf looks around enjoying the familiarity of bag end he turns, knocking his head on the light and then walking into the wooden beam. he groans. gandalf stops in front of a framed map, charred in one corner it is thorin\\'s map of the lonely mountain, gandalf smiles to himself. bilbo jumps, a half eaten pork pie in his hand, as gandalf mysteriously appears behind him. bilbo baggins, you open this door i know you\\'re in there. gandalf watches, amused as bilbo tries to hide. bilbo\\'s fingers close around his waistcoat pocket gripping a small, unseen object. gandalf and bilbo are sitting on the bag end porch. below them, final preparations are being made on the party field. bilbo strikes a match and lights his pipe. bilbo blows a perfect smoke ring and watches it rise into the air. a tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through the center of bilbo\\'s smoke ring. boom. a firework explodes into the night sky high above hobbiton in the shape of a great green tree with unfolding branches. with glowing flowers as they rain down from the branches evaporating just above the up turned faces of the delighted party-goers 144 hobbits, feasting and drinking carts of beer and wine are scattered about, and the tables are piled high with steaming scones and savories. gandalf hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark that dances magically from his staff bilbo is greeting visitors. frodo and sam sit at a table drinking ale frodo notices sam\\'s eyes keep flicking to another pretty hobbit, rosie cotton, sitting some distance away. sam goes to drain his glass suddenly it is snatched out of his hands as frodo thrusts him into the middle of a passing throng of dancers. sam\\'s horrified face as he is swept away. frodo laughs and finishes sam\\'s beer. gandalf as he sets alight a particularly spectacular firework that draws gasps of admiration from the party guests. bilbo is relating stories of his adventure to a group of young hobbit children. a little hobbit girl\\'s upturned face her eyes growing larger and larger. stunned gasps from his young audience greet his astonishing feat. merry and pippin, two mischievous young hobbits in their late teens. pippin scrambles on to the back of gandalf\\'s wagon, snatching up a small firework merry is holding out the big rocket he looks aghast at the fizzing fuse that pippin has just lit. merry fearfully tosses the rocket to pippin. the fuse sizzles angrily. pippin attempts to throw the fizzing rocket back to merry. whoosh. the two hobbits are suddenly blown off their feet in a shower of sparks as the rocket blasts off with frightening power. the rocket zooms over the party it suddenly bursts apart, forming the shape of a great red golden dragon. fire gushes from its nostrils as it turns back and flies low towards the startled crowd. frodo watches the fireworks dragon with alarm but bilbo is oblivious to the panicking crowd and impending danger. frodo as he hurriedly pulls bilbo to the ground, just as the dragon roars a few feet above their heads like a flaming express train. hobbits dive to the ground, tables overturn, tents collapse, food flies everywhere. the fireworks dragon turns a somersault and explodes over the hills with a deafening bang. this gets the biggest cheer of the night. merry and pippin, clothes and hair smoking. large hands suddenly clamp down on merry and pippin\\'s ears. gandalf looking down sternly. merry and pippin are leaning over a barrel, washing dishes in soapy water with gandalf sitting nearby, smoking his pipe and sipping an ale. cries of \"speech. speech\" erupt from the party. bilbo stepping on a stool he bows in gratitude at the applause. a hobbit with particularly big feet scattered clapping as the guests try to work out if that was a compliment or not. frodo and gandalf smiling to themselves. bilbo a strange hum seems to fill his head. a bead of sweat rolls down his brow. bilbo\\'s hand pulls something out of his waistcoat pocket and holds it behind his back. bilbo instantly vanishes. the party explodes into an uproar the crowd leaps to its feet. frodo staring at the empty stool in disbelief. the party is still in an excited uproar some 50 yards away as we pan across a moonlit lane to the front door of bag end. door opens, pulled by an invisible hand. the door quietly closes bilbo materializes as he pulls a plain gold ring off his finger. bilbo laughs as he tosses the ring in the air, then places it in his pocket. bilbo emerges from the passage, carrying a walking stick. he finds gandalf looming over him. bilbo he gives gandalf a look and nods toward the mantelpiece. gandalf looks down at bilbo with rising concern. gandalf rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadow suddenly seems to fill the room bilbo lifts his knapsack and heads for the front door. bilbo hesitates reaches into his pocket. bilbo pulls out the ring he stares at it in his palm. with all his will power, bilbo allows the ring to slowly slide off his palm and drop to the floor. the tiny ring lands with a heavy thud on the wooden floor. bilbo staggering out of bag end he braces himself in the night air, pale and trembling, as if his loss of the ring has weakened him. gandalf steps up behind. bilbo walks away from bag end, disappearing into the night, softly singing \"the road goes on and on.\" the ring glinting on the floor gandalf circles around it, a puzzled look on his face. gandalf slowly reaches for the ring. his fingers barely touch the ring the creepy hum rises on the soundtrack. gandalf is sitting in front of the fire, with his pipe staring into the flickering flames. frodo rushes into bag end he stops and picks up the ring at his feet. gandalf continues staring into the fire, as if locked in thought. gandalf turns his eyes locking onto the ring in frodo\\'s fingers. gandalf sorts hurriedly through bilbo\\'s papers. gandalf holds out the envelope frodo drops the ring into it. gandolf seals the envelope with wax. he hands it to frodo. gandalf is already at the door, he turns to frodo. gandalf hurries out the door leaving frodo standing alone in the bag end. the envelope the camera pushes in the hum of the ring comes up on the soundtrack. the camera pushes through the white paper to the ring beneath the hum the whispered murmur of black speech can be heard. the jagged ruins of\" barad-dur. the dark tower. teasing the huge dark tower of barad-dur is being rebuilt. thousands of orcs crawl over the surface, hauling stone and iron up the towering heights. mount doom a huge, billowing cloud of black filth grows and spreads across the red streaked sky casting a shadowy pall over the nightmarish landscape. nine black riders burst out of minas morgul and charge toward camera. a lone horseman gallops to the crest of a hill on the west road. the main highway south to minas tirith he looks toward the saw toothed mountains of mordor  seeping out across the blood red sky, his face grave. he spurs his horse on. gandalf making is way down into the lower depths of the citidel. pages flipping as gandalf searches ancient scrolls and books placed high on a wooden table. his eyes settle on one old parchment. he murmurs hurriedly to himself, reading. isildur, triumphant, reaches for the one ring, his eyes fixated on it. elvish lettering marks on the faded old document in gandalf\\'s hand. farmer maggot is chopping wood in his garden snorting horse nostrils as the shadow of a black rider looms over a hobbit house. terrified, farmer maggot cowers in his doorway fang, his dog, whimpers and backs away. the black rider gallops away at speed rosie cotton bids the last of the patron\\'s \"goodnight\" sam meets her eyes for a moment as he and frodo leave the inn. frodo farewells sam outside bag end, and heads towards the front door. creepy pov from inside bag end frodo coming up the path. frodo enters bag end he immediately pauses, sensing that something is amiss. all is quiet frodo peers uneasily into the darkened living room. suddenly. a large figure looms out of the shadows, reaching for frodo. frodo lets out a startled cry, pulls himself free and spins around to face his assailant. gandalf steps into a shaft of moonlight. paranoia blazes in his eyes. his clothes are dirty and ragged from much traveling. hair and beard much longer an unkempt. frodo pulls the envelope out of an old chest. gandalf, suspicious, alert. without a word, gandalf takes the envelope and tosses it into the fireplace. flames instantly consume the envelope revealing the ring, as it sinks into the red hot embers. gandalf reaches into the fire with a pair of tongs he lifts the ring out. gandalf drops the ring into frodo\\'s hand he reacts to its weight. gandalf still tense mordor? in the common tongue it says, \"one ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them.\" the ring lies on frodo\\'s simple kitchen table. frodo stunned emanates from the ring. frodo looks at gandalf, each knowing the other has heard it. the ring lies between them on the table. frodo hurriedly entering the living room. gandalf looks at frodo, sadly. a teasing glimpse of gollum being tortured by the orcs. the wretched creature screams in pain. frodo\\'s horrified

ring at gandalf. the ring in frodo\\'s hand. the ring in frodo\\'s clenched hand. frodo throwing clothes into a knapsack gandalf watches him, making plans. frodo is preparing to leave. gandalf looks at the young hobbit, moved by his courage. suddenly. a sound from outside. gandalf freezes he moves quietly towards the window, eyes wide with tension. he raises his staff above the window, and slams it down on the intruder. there is a yelp of pain. gandalf hauls a small figure into the room sam gamgee sprawls across the floor. he looks up in terror as gandalf looms over him. frodo smiles hobbiton shrouded in a white veil of mist. to reveal gandalf, frodo and sam hurrying across a ploughed field, away from hobbiton. gandalf leads his horse frodo and sam are carrying knapsacks. gandalf leads frodo and sam under the cover of woods. gandalf takes frodo to one side. frodo nods he pats his pocket. frodo and sam hiking over the gentle shire countryside wading through a shallow stream heating a kettle over a small fire clambering over stone walls. sam stops short taking stock of his surroundings. sam looks back from where they came. frodo gives sam a pat on the shoulder. sam takes a deep breath and steps forward. sam\\'s brown, furry foot hits the ground. frodo is smiling. frodo and sam continue their journey. gandalf is galloping along the outskirts of the ancient forest of fangorn. nestled in a basin at the foot of the distant misty mountains, the tall black tower of orthanc is clearly visible gandalf gallops through the gate, into the fortress of isengard a great ring-wall of stone, a mile from rim to rim, encloses beautiful trees and gardens, watered by streams that flow down from the mountains. the strange tower of orthanc hewn from a solid pillar of black obsidian rises up in the center of the isengard circle. gandalf arrives at the foot of the orthanc stairs. saruman, the white wizard he sweeps down the orthanc stairs. gandalf moves quickly towards him, grimy and weary from his long ride. gandalf and saruman walk slowly between the beautiful trees of isengard, saruman\\'s clean, white robe contrasts with gandalf\\'s dusty grey robes. saruman and gandalf are seated in a small, cluttered room to the side of the cavernous central chamber. gandalf and saruman stride through orthanc toward a stone plinth on which a sphere like shape is draped with a cloth. saruman lifts the cloth to reveal the palantir. flash a fiery eye. saruman sits upon his throne. gandalf backs away and turns to run to the door horrified as the doors suddenly slam shut. gandalf slowly turns to saruman a look of dawning horror. at that moment gandalf is suddenly blasted across the room. he slams against the wall pinned there by some unseen force. with sudden effort, gandalf wrenches himself off the wall and swings his staff on saruman blasting him off his feet. gandalf and saruman battle, powerful blasts throwing them across the room. saruman screams, eyes blazing. gandalf\\'s staff is suddenly wrenched from his grasp it flies across the chamber into saruman\\'s hand. gandalf is flung to the floor. gandalf is breathing hard on the floor, his eyes look into the madness of saruman commanding two staffs, saruman sends gandalf into a sickening spin. gandalf tumbles towards the top of the chamber as if falling in reverse. the roof of orthanc rockets toward camera. frodo and sam walking along a country lane which borders farmer maggot\\'s fields. sam is looking up frodo has disappeared around a corner in the lane. merry, pippin, and frodo picking themselves up a variety of vegetables have scattered everywhere. merry gives sam a large cabbage. a large pitchfork can be seen racing towards them along the hedgerow angry shouts from farmer maggot. merry and pippin hurriedly gather their booty and race away with frodo and sam on their heels. the baying of large dogs sounds. frodo, sam, and merry and pippin tumble head over heels down a bank, onto a dark, wooded road. a winded pippin, his face inches away from a large pile of horse droppings. frodo picks himself up and looks around quickly. pulls a large carrot, almost broken through in the middle, out from his back pocket. pippin has spied something under the trees on the far side of the road. small, brown mushrooms growing amongst the loamy undergrowth. sam, merry, and pippin race toward the mushrooms. frodo is tense and watchful. he realizes they are on a wooded road. scattered leaves rise into the air whirling down the road as if blown by an invisible wind. suddenly the sound of horses hooves. a long drawn wail comes down the wind, like the cry of some evil and lonely creature. sam grabs merry and pippin as the hobbits quickly scramble down the bank, hiding under a mossy log. the sound of hooves is close a sinister mounted ringwrath steps into view hooded and faceless, mounted on a huge snarling black horse with insane eyes . frodo freezes in terror. the ringwraith pauses right beside their hiding place he sits very still with his head bowed, listening. from inside the hood comes a sniffing noise as if he is trying to catch an elusive scent his head turning from side to side. frodo beads of sweat gather on his brow. the ringwraith suddenly slides off his horse, leaning over the mossy log, peering suspiciously into the woods. frodo he is drawing the ring out of his pocket, with trembling hands his face fevered and sweating as if in the grip of some terrible internal struggle. the sound of sniffing intensifies as the ringwraith darts his head from side to side like a bird of party. frodo squeezing his eyes shut. quick psychic blasts. and evil dark tower a great eye a burst of flame. sam looking at frodo with concern merry desperately hurls the mushrooms across the road the ringwraith spins around at the sound, and darts to the far side of the road with frightening speed. frodo instantly slumps as if a psychic link had been broken frodo is staring, a look of shock on his face at the ring lying in the palm of his hand. frodo, sam, merry, and pippin hurry through the trees slipping and sliding on the muddy ground. merry moves past pippin, toward frodo, watching intently sam keeps looking around nervously. the silhouette of a black rider looms against the skyline. the four hobbits sprawled on the ground, holding their breath. the black rider turns and departs. merry looks at his friend realizing frodo is in deep trouble. the hobbits break cover. suddenly, a ringwraith bursts out of the forest toward them. the hobbits run the ringwraith shrieks. frodo, sam, merry and pippin, are running towards the wide, placid brandywine river and the ferry. stomping hooves snarling horses. four ringwraiths are speeding through the fog converging on the ferry crossing. the hobbits stampede across the wharf and tumble onto the ferry. frodo races across the wooden wharf, followed by the ringwraiths. he leaps into the ferry. hooves thunder down the wooden wharf. sam and merry shove off with the poles the ferry slides out into the river, just as the ringwraiths arrive. they pull up on the end of the wharf shrieking with rage. the hobbits cover their ears. the ringwraiths wheel their horses towards the north and gallop away along the river bank, quickly disappearing into the fog. lights of bree a small village of stone and half timbered houses nestled against a low wooded hill. a thick hedge surrounds the village a great gate bars the western entrance. frodo, sam, merry and pippin approaching the gatehouse wild eyes, ragged, and out of breath. a surly gatekeeper glances down at them. the gatekeeper swings his lantern onto the hobbits, bathing them in an uncomfortable yellow spotlight. the hobbits gratefully enter bree the gatekeeper eyeing them curiously in the lantern light. the tall bree folk loom over the nervous little hobbits as frodo, sam, merry and pippin make their way through the narrow streets. tall buildings tower above them lights glow dimly from behind thick curtains. the sign of the \"prancing pony inn\" frodo, sam, merry, and pippin hurry toward it. frodo, sam, merry and pippin come rushing in. frodo attracts the inn keepers\\'s attention. the noise, smokey inn. it is dimly lit, cheifly from a blazing log fire and crowded with a mixture of big folk, local hobbits, and a couple of dwarfs. frodo, sam, merry and pippin are sitting at a table against the wall clearly trying to remain quiet and inconspicuous sam can\\'t help himself he keeps casting nervous glances around. merry ploinks himself down at a table, carrying a very large mug of beer. sam watches pippin rise unsteadily to his feet and head to the bar. a couple of swarthy men leaning against the bar glance at frodo, then quickly look away. sam indicates a brooding stranger who sits alone at a table in the far corner, smoking a curiously carved long stemmed pipe, peering from beneath a travel stained cowl with gleaming eyes. frodo gestures to butterbur. beneath table frodo\\'s fingers are nervously toying with the ring. frodo sweat runs down his brow. the strange hum of the ring spills into the soundtrack. baggins baggins  a creepy whisper seems to fill frodo\\'s head sound that dissolves into pippin\\'s loud voice pippin sitting at the bar, chatting with locals. frodo leaps to his feet and pushes his way towards the bar. frodo grabs pippin\\'s sleeve, spilling his beer. pippin pushes frodo away he stumbles backwards, and falls to the floor. at that instant, the inn goes silent and all the attention turns to frodo. the ring in agonizing slow motion we watch as it seems to hang in the air for a split second then crashes down onto his out stretched finger. frodo vanishes. there is a sharp intake of breath followed by total silence. the ringwraiths turn sharply in their saddles instantly aware that the ring is being worn. they spur their horses towards the distant lights of bree. sam looks sick pippin instantly sobers, realizing his folly the brooding stranger frowns and the inn erupts into excited babble. frodo as he finds himself in the twilight world of the ring the excited crowd are suddenly moving in slow motion distorted voices a weird photographic negative quality. frodo is moving in real time against the slow motion background. he suddenly clutches his head as he is hit with quick images of a great eye. an evil cat-like eye, wreathed in flames. voice of sauron there is no life here in the void only cold only death frodo is terrified. he rolls under a table, desperately pulling the ring from his finger. frodo materializes into the real world. at that moment a large hand reaches under the table and grabs frodo by the collar, and drags him away. frodo is roughly pushed against the wall. the brooding stranger looms over him. frodo is pushed into the hobbit\\'s room by strider. the door bursts open and sam, merry and pippin appear on the doorway. sam is squaring off with is fists, merry brandishes a candlestick, and pippin a chair. strider sheaths his sword, a slight smile playing on his lips. the gate keeper comes out of his lodgings with a lantern a look of fear on his face. he approaches the closed gate with great apprehension. the gatekeeper peers out of his peephole. crash. the gate crashed down on the gatekeeper as four ringwraiths ride into bree. the four ringwraiths fly done the empty streets, like horsemen of the apocalypse. the front door flies open. the four ringwraiths rush into the prancing pony with wicked swords drawn. butterbur hiding behind his bar trembling and sweating in terror. merry snoring softly on his pillow. pippin stirs slightly, then settles back to sleep. the door creaks open the four ringwraiths silently slide into the hobbit\\'s room. the loom above each bed, raising their shining swords above the sleeping hobbits. sam\\'s eyes open wide. in unison, the ringwraits stab the hobbits, in a slashing, hacking frenzy. strider is grimly listening to the sounds from his room. the ringwraiths step back from the slashed beds in triumph. a hacked blanket is pulled back to reveal nothing but a shredded pillow. the ringwraiths shriek with rage sam sits up with a start. another shredded pillow is revealed. more shrieks of rage. pippin and merry wake with a start. sam, merry, and pippin have been sleeping on strider\\'s bed. frodo stands next to strider by the window, peering out nervously as furious ringwraith screeches echo across the courtyard from the hobbits room. strider looks from the window as the ringwraiths gallop down the bree streets. strider turns back to the hobbits, his face lit faintly by the glowing embers of the fire. strider, merry, pippin, and frodo march through a gloomy, overgrown forest. sam follows at the read leading \"bill\", a scrawny pony, who is laden with supplies. frodo watches uneasily as strider moves off into the cover of the trees. sam looks excited. strider leads the hobbits through the gloom of the forest. strider leading frodo, sam, merry, and pippin across the windswept moors. the hobbits suddenly stop and unstrap their knapsacks. strider stares at pippin blankly, then turns away, shaking his head. an apple is thrown to merry, who deftly catches it. another, aimed at pippin, catches him on the forehead. the hobbits trudge through rain, looking tired, hungry, and miserable. saruman stands over the palantir, his hands cupping the massive eye. black speech fills the room admist the harsh, guttural words the voice of saruman emerges. saruman is seated as his orc overseer approaches. gandalf lying unconscious on a cold obsidian floor. he wakes to the sound of ripping and tearing rising onto his knees lifting his head gandalf stands as the camera pulls back to reveal him stranded on the summit of orthanc. he is marooned on the tiny, flat peak, surrounded on all sides by a sheer 500 foot drop. another whispering wail rends the air. gandalf crosses quickly to the edge and peers down one of the beautiful isengard trees is being ripped from the ground by the orcs. gandalf looks on in horror as orcs hack into the trunk with axes. more and more trees are hauled down and killed as gandalf looks on in helpless despair. the rugged countryside as the hobbits journey on, lead by strider. strider stops before a distant hill, topped by an ancient ruin. frodo, merry, and pippin collapse into a small hollow, halfway up weathertop they are muddy and exhausted. stider drops 4 small swords at the hobbits feet. frodo eyes flickering open. he suddenly sits up, sniffing the air. sam, merry, and pippin huddled over a small fire sausages and bacon sizzle in a hot frying pan. a sudden shreik. five ringwraiths on foot, running up the steep slope unnaturally fast. frodo, sam, merry and pippin clamber desperately towards the summit, clutching their swords. frodo, sam, merry, and pippin race into a ring of broken stones on the summit or weathertop the ruined base of an ancient tower. the hobbits stand back-to-back in the centre of the ring, waiting for the first assault one by one, the 5 ringwraiths appear brandishing gleaming swords, they move slowly towards the hobbits. in the center is their leader the witch king. sam rushes forward with a cry. he swings his sword at the witch king, who blocks the blow with his own sword. sam\\'s blade shatters the witch king lashes out with his fist, sending sam flying. merry and pippin, overcome with terror, throw themselves flat on the ground. the ringwraiths close in on frodo a venomous whisper dances in his head. frodo shuts his eyes and staggers back, desperately resisting the wraith\\'s whisperings slow motion as his hand goes into his pocket and pulls out the ring. the 5 ringwraiths utter a chilling screech of excitement. frodo is unable to resist any longer, falls to his knees and slips on the ring. he disappears. frodo finds himself in the weird twilight world he looks upon the ringwraiths, now visible in their true appearance five ghouls dressed in long grey robes, with white hair, and pallid, ruthless faces. the witch king extends a haggard hand towards frodo, reaching for the ring on his finger. frodo\\'s trembling hand extends forward as if by the pull of the ring he slides to the ground, unable to pull his hand away. the witch king snarls and springs forward. he stabs at frodo with a wicked dagger. frodo winces as the tip of the dagger sinks into his shoulder. suddenly, strider charges at the ringwraiths, wielding his sword in one hand, a flaming torch in the other. he moves in slow motion, visible through a sea of mist. frodo sinks to the ground. behind him is a faint image of a ringwraith fleeing, his head engulfed in flames. with draining strength, frodo manages to pull the ring off his finger.  appearing back in the real world, sam rushes over to him. another ringwraith is burning and screaming others screech fearfully at the flames, turn and flee form the weathertop summit. strider kneels before frodo. he snatches up the witch king\\'s dagger from the ground, staring gravely at the long, thin, blade. strider is jogging grimly, carrying an ailing frodo on his back. sam, merry, and pippin are running to keep up. the hobbits are carrying flaming torches for protection. low angle looking up at orthanc the tower of isengard, gleaming in the moonlight. the camera rises to reveal the once beautiful gardens are not a pitted wasteland with smoke and fire billowing out of numerous tunnels and vent holes that litter the forecourt of orthanc. strange guttural chants echo up from deep underground. the camera is rising a small moth flutters into shot and leads the camera towards the summit or orthanc. gandalf lies slumped against the wall at the very top of orthanc, surrounded by a sheer 500 foot drop. he looks weak and frail and is seemingly asleep. the moth flutters close to gandalf. his hand suddenly moves at lighting speed and snatches the moth. gandalf brings his hand close to his face and opens it. the moth sits on the palm of his hand as gandalf mutter strange words in a foreign tongue. the moth\\'s face seemingly listening. it suddenly flutters away. camera follows the moth off the orthanc summit, but drops past the moth falling down, down, towards the pitted wasteland, straight into a fiery red tunnel. the dead trees of isengard are fed into roaring furnaces molten metal pours into casts red hot metal, beaten my sweating orc blacksmiths armor and weapons are forged from the great furnaces. saruman strides among the orcs and stands looking on a new born uruk-hai as it escapes its birthing membrane this is lurtz, who rises up to stand before his master. frodo his eyes flicker open clouded, red- rimmed his brow, beaded with sweat. a distant cry of a ringwraith carries through the air. frodo gasps in sudden pain. sam and strider desperately search the dark forest floor for the athelas plant. a small, white flowered plant. strider drops to one knee, carefully pulling it from the ground. suddenly. strider freezes as a sword blade touches his neck. strider slowly looks up. frodo is breathing hard, desperately ill. surreal impression a shimmering figure in white leaps off a horse. an ethereal vision of arwen, as she appears on the other side. arwen who now appears in her earth bound form, a young elven woman with tousled hair, dressed in mud-splattered riding clothes. arwen reaches for strider\\'s hand looking deep into his eyes. arwen mounts her horse, alsforth. arwen looks down at strider as she supports frodo with one hand. asfaloth springs away, bearing arwen and frodo into the night. through the forest from the back of the white horse. frodo, bouncing in the saddle, he lifts his head weakly. surreal the horses head bobbing trees sliding by moonlight flickers through the trees. of arwen\\'s white horse emerging from the trees and galloping across the open land as the sun rises. the white horse charges through a pine forest. suddenly 2 galloping ringwraiths emerge from the trees behind. 2 more ringwraiths slide in from different directions to join the chase. arwen grits her teeth urges the white horse to greater speed. the white horse speeds out of the pine trees the 4 ringwraiths close behind 2 more ringwraiths galloping down the hillside. 3 more ringwraiths enter frame from different directions a total of 9 ringwraiths now pursuing frodo and arwen. panting head of the white elven horse. as the white horse races towards camera, to reveal the wide river bruinen in the foreground. without hesitation, the white horse leaps into the shallow water and thunders across the ford. the 9 ringwraiths pull up short of the ford, clearly nervous of the water. the white horse reaches the other side arwen pulls up and turns to defiantly face the ringwraiths from across the ford. the witch king screeches angrily, draws his sword, and leads the ringwraiths across the ford. the water starts flowing faster a distant rumble can be heard. arwen waits until they are halfway across she suddenly stands in the saddle arms raised. the ground suddenly trembles a mighty roar fills the air. frodo looks up weakly to see a vast torrent of water flooding down the river towards the ford as if a dam had burst. the foaming water seems to form the shape of dancing white horses with frothing manes. the ringwraiths scream in terror as they are swallowed up in the deluge. their piercing cries are drowned in the roaring of the river as it carries them away. frodo as he loses consciousness. arwen gathers the small hobbit in her arms, feeling his life slip away. delirious images and sounds. a bright light suddenly flares frodo squeezes his eyes shut, gasping. a familiar voice cuts through the swirl of sound. frodo\\'s eyes flicker open he is lying in bed next to an open window dappled sunlight plays on richly carved timbers the sound of a nearby waterfall drifts through the vista of fir trees. gandalf is sitting next to frodo\\'s bed. softly puffing on his pipe. he smiles at frodo. frodo sits up, looking at gandalf questioningly. gandalf troubled. his eyes drift away. saruman stands over gandalf, gloating. with the power of his staff, saruman raises gandalf from the ground, then sends him crashing to the floor. suddenly. gandalf lurches to his feet and throws himself off the tower. saruman watches gandalf fly away from isengard on the back of a giant eagle. gwaihir the eagle soars majestically over the mountains, carrying gandalf towards the dawn. frodo raises himself up and looks at gandalf. sam runs to frodo\\'s bedside. he is overjoyed to find frodo awake. bedside his face is neither old nor young, though in it is written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful. rivendell a small cluster of elegant elven buildings sitting in a shangri-la like valley below towering cliffs and snow capped mountains. frodo and sam walk together. suddenly, the voices of merry and pippin can be heard as they bound up to frodo and throw their arms around him. sam looks past frodo smiling a bent figure sits alone on a bench, in the sun. frodo turning, following sam\\'s gaze. bilbo baggins. he breaks in to a broad grin as frodo rushes forward to embrace him. bilbo has aged significantly since we last saw him. later frodo is turning the neatly inscribed title page of a red leather bound journal bilbo smiles proudly. he is sitting with frodo on a terrace overlooking a waterfall. frodo looks at page after page of beautiful handwriting, with intricate maps and drawings. frodo turns a page there before him, is a map of the shire. sam busily tries to stuff more and more things into his already full pack pots and pans, blankets, cooking utensils, provisions, clothes. sam looks up, startled. gandalf and elrond watch frodo and sam from elrond\\'s balcony, elrond turns and walks away. gandalf turns and looks out the window. sounds of arrivals gandalf watches as boromir rides through rivendell gate, followed by legolas and gimli. with the broken sword, isildur slices off sauron\\'s finger. elrond reacts. isildur picks up the ring and stares at it, entranced. elrond and isildur stand before the fires of mt. doom. isildur captivated by the ring. isildur turns and walks away elrond turns to gandalf. strider watches from the shadows as boromir strolls through the darkened gallery. boromir\\'s eyes are drawn to an old fresco on the wall depicting isildur defeating sauron. boromir looks with wonderment at narsil, the broken blade of elendil, which lies on a cloth-covered plinth. boromir senses strider\\'s presence he looks from the blade to strider, as if sensing a connection. strider picks up the broken hilt, as arwen appears behind him. night falls upon the beautiful valley of rivendell still and quiet. strider and arwen stand upon a stone bridge the evenstar at arwen\\'s breast shines in the moonlight. arwen reaches up and gently touches the grey at strider\\'s temples. arwen looks into strider\\'s eyes. arwen closes strider\\'s fingers around the jewel. arwen leans towards strider, gently kissing him. elrond addresses the council. frodo sits amongst a council of free-peoples of middle earth, elrond stands before them, addressing gandalf, strider, legolas, and 20 other elves, dwarves, and men. frodo steps forward and moves towards a stone plinth. he places the ring on the plinth and returns to his seat. strider says nothing and boromir turns away dismissively. legolas stands. frodo looks at strider questioningly boromir turns sharply. gimli suddenly rushes forward. he swings his axe down on the ring. the axe shatters with a deafening crack. gimli falls backwards, staring in disbelief at the ring unharmed. frodo winces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him. he slumps in this chair, clutching his forehead. gandalf looks at him with concern. stunned silence the council sits with downcast eyes, as if a great dread has descended on them. boromir addresses the council in a quiet voice gimli leaps to his feet. motion the angry faces, the shaking fists, the accusatory fingers, his eyes move across to the ring the hum grows louder in his head. the ring fills the screen streams of blood flow across the surface flames flicker within the gold band. frodo breathing rapidly, caught in the grip of his hideous vision. with a huge effort or will, frodo tears his gaze upon the ring. frodo suddenly stands he speaks in a strong, clear voice. sudden silence frodo looks around the room at the astounded faces. boromir looks at them all then walks towards frodo. boromir looks towards elrond and gandalf. frodo stares in wonder as the greatest fighters in all middle earth stand at his side. a sudden noise sam pops up from behind a bush. merry and pippin jump up from behind another bush. elrond surveys the group an old sword sliding out of a shabby leather scabbard its polished, well tendered blade glitters cold and bright. bilbo offers sting to frodo. bilbo unwraps a small shirt of close woven mail. frodo peels off his shirt revealing the ring on the chain around his neck. bilbo sobs and frodo moves to comfort him. the fellowship climb the long steep path out of the cloven vale of rivendell. the fellowship trekking through a land of deep valleys and turbulent waters the misty mountains rise sharply to their left. sam at the campfire. the sound of clashing swords. aragorn and boromir are giving pippin sword tuition. gimli has managed to corner gandalf. boromir thrusts, catching pippin on the hand. pippin throws down his sword, kicks and lunges at boromir, tackling him to the ground. much laughter. legolas\\' eyes are fixed on a distant dark patch which darts about the sky, like flying smoke in the wind. there is as a regiment of large crows fly low overhead at great speed, wheeling and circling above. as their dark shadow passes over the fellowship, a single harsh croak is heard and the crows suddenly wheel away, back towards the south. gandalf staggers to his feet. gandalf looks at aragorn, turns to the others gesturing towards a high mountain pass. the fellowship clamber through rock and snow. frodo slips on some shale as he scrambles to his feet, the ring falls on the ground the ring gleaming in the snow. boromir\\'s hand picks it up by the chain he stands, the ring dangling before his eyes. he seems to grow in stature, as if absorbing its power. aragorn warily approaches boromir boromir is motionless he stares at the ring, as if transfixed. boromir smiles at frodo, ruffling his hair. aragon unhands his sword. following the crows as they race deeper and deeper, passing a vista of industry, hundreds of orcs and writhing birthsacks flying past saruman, who stands upon a wooden gantry. saruman, listening to the cries of the crows. the fellowship are struggling through a blinding blizzard, up towards the pass of caradhras. legolas the elf moves lightly across the top of the snow he suddenly pauses. saruman\\'s voice sweeps by in the wind. thunder rumbles rock and shale fall from above. gandalf raises his staff he chants into the wind. camera sweeps past saruman he stands on the summit of orthanc, chanting. clouds are flowing from all directions converging on the distant mountains in a stormy malestrom. saruman\\'s voice strengthens rolling past the fellowship like thunder. a lightning crack explodes on the mountainside above them. frodo looks up in horror as a huge snow avalanche thunders down towards them. the fellowship throw themselves against the cliff face as snow crashes onto the narrow ledge. legolas pulls gandalf to safety. aragorn shields frodo and sam as snow piles around them. within moments, the pass is blocked and the fellowship are enveloped in snow. boromir and aragorn frantically dig for the hobbits who are pulled out shivering and fearful. frodo, the weight of the decision weighing heavily upon him. merry and pippin shivering in boromir\\'s arms. frodo meets gandalf\\'s eye. the fellowship are walking along the far shore of dark lake directly below great looming cliffs. footing is treacherous on the narrow strip of green and greasy stones. gandalf touches the smooth rock wall between the trees slowly, faint lines appear like slender veins of luminous silver running through the stone. a large moon rises over the mountains the lines grow broader and clearer, forming a glowing arch of interlacing ancient letters and symbols. gandalf raises his arms. the cliff towers into the night, the wind blows cold, frodo shivers and the door stands fast. gandalf continues. mumbling spells in his efforts to open the door. sam packs pots and pans at his feet watching sadly as aragorn un- saddles bill the pony. aragorn whispering to bill the pony. splash. merry and pippin are tossing stones into the lake. black rippling rings slowly fan out. pippin is about to throw another stone, but aragorn grabs his arm. aragorn watches anxiously as the ripples appear to grow he exchanges a look with boromir. aragorn\\'s hand creeps towards his sword. gandalf gives up in despair he sits down beside frodo. frodo peers at the elvish inscription his face breaks into a smile of comprehension. gandalf raises his eyebrows. with that, the rock face silently divides in the middle and two great doors swing outwards revealing a blackness deeper than the night. as the fellowship enter the blackness, something in the water stirs. the fellowship step warily into the darkness of moria a dank cavern, with winding steps leading deeper into the mountain. a glow from gandalf\\'s staff suddenly lights the chamber the fellowship recoil in horror. many dwarf skeletons are strewn about, clearly the dead of some old battle the rusting armor and shields are peppered with arrows and axes. the fellowship draw swords and back away, towards the entrance. frodo is suddenly pulled to the ground. a long sinuous tentacle is wrapped around frodo\\'s ankle and is dragging him towards the lake. frodo cries out as aragorn and boromir rush forward. aragorn severs the tentacle holding frodo, and pulls him to safety boromir hacks at the other writhing limbs. 20 more tentacles ripple out of the lake. the dark water boils as the hideous beast lashes out at the fellowship. again the creature grabs frodo and pulls him to the lake, frodo is flung in the air as the fellowship battle the creature. aragorn hacks at a tentacle frodo is released, falling into boromir\\'s arms. legolas shoots an arrow into the creature\\'s head, gaining a few vital seconds for aragorn and boromir as they race out of the water with frodo. the fellowship hurriedly back away from the creature retreating into the moria chamber as many coiling arms seize the large doors. with a shattering echo, the creature rips the doors away, creating a rock slide that crashes down the cliff face. within seconds, tons of rock seal the doorway throwing the fellowship into pitch blackness. the fellowship crossing a precarious bridge above deep mine workings. they continue up a steep stair, passing through a dwarf cemetery. the graves are despoiled dwarf skeletons are strewn about and goblin graffiti is scrawled on monuments in dried dwarf blood. the atmosphere is very sinister. the path splits into three passages each disappearing into dark tunnels. gandalf pauses, frowning. later the fellowship are nervously waiting while gandalf sits, staring intently at the 3 tunnel mouths in front of him. he appears to be in some kind of trance. frodo he turns at the sound of a faint noise down the tunnel behind them. a sudden glimpse of a creature darting in the darkness. frodo is nervous he approaches gandalf. teasing shot and emaciated, leering creature. gollum\\'s withered fingers are gripping the cave wall he is large, luminous eyes blinking with malice. the fellowship pass under an arched doorway into a black and empty space. gandalf pauses. blazes like a silent flash of lightning. great shadows spring up and flee. their heads, upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone. before them stretches a huge empty hall, with black walls, polished and smooth as glass. ahead of them, a wooden door has been smashed. black arrows are embedded in the timbers. two goblin skeletons lie in the doorway. gimli rushes ahead. gimli rushes into another vast empty chamber lit with a narrow shaft of sunlight, beaming in from a small hole near the roof. dwarf and goblin skeletons are piled high. in the far corner sits a stone walled well. a shaft of light falls directly onto a stone table in the middle of the room a single oblong block, about 4 feet high, topped with a great slab of white stone. gimli falls to his knees. gimli sobs. gandalf quietly reads an inscription of runes, carved onto the white stone slab. gandalf carefully lifts the rotting remains of a book from the white stone slab. it has been slashed and stabbed and appears to be covered in dried blood. the pages crack and break as he opens it. unnerved, pippin backs away nervously he stumbles against the well, sending a precariously balanced armored skeleton tumbling in. merry reaches out, grabbing hold of pippin before he falls. the fellowship freeze in stunned silence as the armored skeleton clatters down the deep well echoing loudly. gandalf turns angrily on pippin. pippin, chastened. they fall silent. a low rolling boom rises from the depths below growing louder boom boom as if the caverns of moria were turned into a vast drum. a great horn blasts nearby answering horns running feet harsh cries sam\\'s eyes glance at frodo\\'s belt. aragorn and boromir slam and wedge the doors. boromir catches sight of something he turns to aragorn with shock in his eyes. gimli snatches up two rusty dwarf axes and leaps onto the tomb. boom. the door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments, and 20 goblins charge into the tomb, followed by a huge cave troll. gimli ducks a blow and immediately buries his axes in 2 goblin helmets. aragorn and boromir wade into the mass of goblins with their swords. legolas fires deadly arrows into goblin throats, desperately trying to shield the hobbits. gandalf is clutching his sword and joins in the battle. the cave troll is sweeping his club at aragorn who stumbles backwards the huge club descends for the killing blow suddenly, in a flash of steel, boromir\\'s long sword slices into the scaly arm of the troll it rears back, spewing green blood. sam is backing up against a wall a sword in one hand, a saucepan in the other. in desperation he swings wildly at a goblin with a saucepan. it keels over sam looks surprised. he wallops another goblin and it too, drops. the cave troll lunges forward, thrusting at frodo\\'s chest with his spear. the hobbits go crazy. sam slashes at the cave troll\\'s knee, bringing him down merry and pippin jump on him legolas fires an arrow and the cave troll topples, dead. aragorn rushes to frodo\\'s side as he slumps to the floor frodo appears to be dead. gandalf, aragorn, hobbits looking horrified suddenly frodo coughs takes a huge breath. frodo open his shirt to reveal the mithril vest. the troll spear did not pierce the mithril.\" boom. boom. boom the sound of the drums rings out again. gandalf turns to the others. gandalf leads the fellowship into the huge dwarrowdelf chamber. a huge shadow, surrounded by flame, falls across the hall the ground shakes an unearthly sound rumbles. the balrog, a massive creature rises from a chasm, a great 40 foot man-beast, with a mane of flames. in one hand is a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire in the other, a whip of many thongs. aragorn leads the fellowship to the top of a dizzying stairway gandalf follows, leaning heavily on his staff. aragorn looks at gandalf, concerned. aragorn hesitates gandalf looks at him. the fellowship race down the stairway, aragorn picks up frodo leaping across a gaping chasm. a narrow bridge, spanning a bottomless pit gandalf yells to the others aragorn makes to throw gimli across the chasm. the fellowship run into a hall the floor is split with fissures that spit flame. they race towards the slender bridge of stone without kerb or rail at the far end of the hall. the fellowship recklessly hurry over the dizzying bridge but gandalf the last pauses in the middle of the span he faces the balrog staff in one hand sword in the other. frodo looks back in horror frodo watches as the balrog puts one foot on the bridge and draws up to full height, wings spreading from wall-to-wall. gandalf is a tiny figure, balanced precariously on the narrow bridge. flame gandalf blocks with his sword a ringing clash and the balrog\\'s sword shatters into molten fragments. gandalf cries aloud as he summons up his last reserves of strength. he thumps the bridge with his staff a blinding sheet of white flame springs up the staff shatters the bridge breaks right at balrog\\'s feet. the stone bridge drops away into the gulf from under the balrog. for a moment, the great beast remains poised in the air then it plunges down in slow motion relief floods frodo\\'s face gandalf remains trembling on the lip of the broken bridge. as the balrog falls, he lashes out with his whip of fire the thongs of the whip lash and curl around gandalf\\'s knees, dragging him over the brink. gandalf just manages to hand on by his fingertips gandalf lets go his grip and falls away following the balrog into the bottomless abyss. frodo cries out. boromir scoops him up and carries him away. they rush towards an archway. the fellowship tumble out of the great eastern gate on to a grassy sunlit hillside. sam, merry, and pippin fall slowly to the ground, sobbing aragorn turns to legolas and gimli. frodo slowly turns a look of numb shock on his devastated face. the fellowship marches on. aragorn scours ahead of the company, as they stumble on in the fading light in the distance the shimmer of a large forest can be seen lothlorien. the fellowship run across a forest floor strewn with yellow flowers above is a roof of golden leaves, held up by silver pillars the trunks of huge, grey trees. gimli looks nervously around. frodo hesitates a strange voice whispers in his head. haldir\\'s eyes lock onto frodo. haldir leads the fellowship onto a hill top. they look with wonderment at the vista spread before them. several miles towards the south, a large hill rises out of the woods. upon the hill rise many mighty mallorn trees, taller than any others nestled high in the crown of the mallorns is a beautiful city. it gleams in the low rays of the late afternoon sun green, gold, and silver. to the east of caras galadhon, the woods of lorien run down the pale gleam of anduin, the great river. beyond the river, the land appears flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away, it rises again like a dark and dreary wall. the sun that lies on lothlorien has not power to enlighten the shadows that lie beyond. the fellowship step onto a wide fleet filled with a soft light. the walls are green and silver, the roof gold and in its midst is the trunk of the might mallorn tree, now tapering toward its crown. celeborn steps forward to greet the guests. his hair is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no sign of age upon it. next to him stands galadriel, the lady of the elves. she has hair of deep gold and timeless, unsurpassed beauty. celeborn looks hard at aragorn. frodo looks at galadriel, standing silently beside celeborn. galadriel\\'s eyes settle on sam. side powerful, divine no longer of this world a piercing white light surrounds her. gimli, legolas, merry, pippin, frodo and sam are in a pavilion set among the trees near the fountain. they lie on soft couches as elves leave food and wine for them. mournful singing drifts down from the trees above. moonlight catches the trace of tears on boromir\\'s face. aragorn kneels down beside him. boromir looks at aragorn in despair. aragorn returns boromir\\'s smile betraying his disquiet sadness only when boromir looks away. later. the fellowship are asleep on their beds. gimli is snoring loudly. bare feet tread soundlessly across the lawn. frodo\\'s eyes flicker open as if by instinct. galadriel, her white dress glowing in the moonlight, glances at him. frodo follows her as if drawn by an invisible force. upon a low stone pedestal, carved like a branching tree, sits a shallow silver basin. galadriel leads frodo into the small glade. galadriel pours water into the basin from a silver jug a glow rises from the water. frodo slowly steps up to the pedestal he peers into the glossy surface. the night sky is reflected into the water suddenly a figure takes form the bowed figure of an old man, clad in white robes. he walks down a long road. frodo leans closer to the mirror\\'s surface. gandalf lifts his head and looks directly at frodo. frodo gasps, his face lighting up with hope. gandalf looks at frodo with a fierce intensity. frodo reaches out his hand toward the surface of the mirror. suddenly the image flares, burning out to white. the vision shifts frodo gasps in horror. the shire is in ruins. the image suddenly widens to fill the screen buildings burning bodies strewn about dark shapes of orcs looting and destroying bag end, billowing in flames. the party tree is hacked down. frodo reels back as the mirror seems to grow the nightmarish image sweeps past his head, engulfing him entirely. hobbiton now an industrial wasteland. the fields and trees destroyed replaced with brick factories belching smoke. orcs brutally herd manacled hobbits into the factories. we see sam merry and rosie cotton. soot- stained and sobbing, they disappear into the factory hell- hole. suddenly, the mirror goes dark and out of the black abyss a single eye grows. frodo is frozen. unable to move or cry out. the ring dangles from his neck, inches above the water not shimmering with curls of steam. fire erupts around the eye with a yell, frodo pushes himself away from the pedestal and collapses on the ground. light instantly fades from the mirror. frodo comes to his senses he is shocked. galadriel stands still as a statue, unmoved, untouched by the horror. galadriel looks at frodo intensely frodo looks down in his hand he is clutching the ring. frodo looks up at galadriel. galadriel suddenly seems to rise in stature before frodo\\'s eyes. frodo is suddenly afraid of her. galadriel suddenly laughs a slender elf-woman once more, clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad. frodo realizes what her message is. the ring lies in the palm of frodo\\'s hand his fingers close over it. naked, lurtz\\'s eyes follow saruman, alight with a mean intelligence. lurtz is quickly armored breastplate leg guards, helmet a sword is thrust in lurtz\\'s hand. the uruk- hai are smearing themselves in white paint a creepy ritualistic ceremony the white hand of isengard is smeared on bodies, faces, and armor. saruman address a crowd of 200 fully armed uruk-hai. lurtz is leading 200 uruk-hai out of isengard they run fast, their powerful legs carrying them at speed. the fellowship are in small elven boats. they row away from the lothlorien shore into the silverlode river. elves quietly watch them depart. galadriel gives frodo a small crystal phial. the boats pass into the great river anduin. the three elven boats carry the fellowship steadily southward. green trees slowly give way to a brown and withered land. the uruk forces are running through the trees with deadly purpose. a flock of birds circle high above, black against the pale sky. aragorn watches them with concern. the three elven boats drift slowly through the steep rocky gorge in the pre-dawn light. aragorn, slowly paddling in the stern. frodo slowly looks up, his eyes widening with amazement. two enormous rock statues, towering like 300 foot pinnacles on either side of the river carved images of gondorian kings of old. they loom over the boats with power and majesty. aragorn strangely moved by the beauty of the silent sentinels. he speaks, almost as if to himself. the fellowship stare in stunned silence as the current takes them through the narrow gap between the statues\\' feet. the fellowship as they leap out of the boats and clamber onto the wooded shore. legolas turns to aragorn with urgency. legolas casts a glance around into the parth galen forest. sam sits up with a start aragorn\\'s head snaps round his eyes fly to boromir\\'s shield which lies abandoned by his camp bed. aragorn as he realizes boromir has gone. frodo is walking beneath the trees lost in thought. his feet hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab his eyes follow an overgrown path towards stone stairs leading to the summit of amon hen the seeing seat. a crackling sound. frodo freezes. frodo turns slowly he stares at boromir, tense, cautious. frodo stands silent for a moment the murmur of the wind in the trees and the distant roar of the falls of rauros can be heard boromir has started forward towards frodo, he pulls himself up. frodo steps hurriedly away from boromir. frodo turns to leave. boromir leaps on top of frodo, grasping for the ring. frodo has only moments to act. frodo rips the ring from around his neck and rams it on his finger. frodo races through the misty twilight world, past the foggy shapes of twisted trees. somewhere behind him, boromir\\'s distraught voice carries from another dimension frodo suddenly finds himself on the stone steps he clambers up the stairs, onto a high seat, perched on four stone pillars. frodo cowers on the seat, like a lost child upon the throne of mountain kings. the world of mist swirls around him. frodo peers out from the seat the world seems to shrink. in all directions, views of far off lands telescope towards him through the mist. orcs spilling out of holes in the misty mountains flames rising from mirkwood grim faced easterlings march to war black ships sailing into the south. all the power of the dark lord is in motion. frodo moves his gaze towards the east fire explodes against the smoke, as a huge mass of black battlements fills frodo\\'s vision. a mountain of iron, immeasurably strong, tower of adamant barad-dur, fortress of sauron. suddenly. sauron\\'s eye leaps toward frodo like a finger of light. they will fall. frodo leaps off the seat, and tumbles down the stairs. the eye sweeps amon hen like a searchlight, seeking its ring. with a huge effort, frodo wrenches the ring off his finger. frodo lies gasping on the summit of amon hen below the ancient ruins of the seeing seat. at that moment a black boot steps into shot. frodo looks up as aragorn towers over him. frodo backs away from aragorn aragorn is shocked by the movement. frodo uncurls his fist in is palm lies the ring. it glints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun aragorn\\'s eyes are drawn to it. aragorn freezes. he draws his sword. frodo hesitates. frodo backs away into the trees as 200 uruk-hai swarm onto amon hen behind aragorn. aragorn attacks the leading uruk-hai like a madman he brings two down with his sword leaping into the ruins as others close in on him. frodo scrambles down the hillside, away from the fight. aragorn battles the uruk-hai, amongst the pillars and blocks of amon hen. despite his bravery, he is quickly surrounded suddenly elven arrows smash into the uruk-hai. legolas races out of the woods, firing his bow. gimli leaps into the battle, wielding his might axe. frodo is darting down the steep hillside as heave feet thunder down behind him. sam looks around for frodo. lurtz ordering his uruks. frodo stumbles and falls quickly he crawls behind a tree above him the sound of uruk-hai crashing through the forest rings out. frodo turns to see merry and pippin hidden in a hollow, a few feet away. frodo looks at his friends slowly shakes his head, a great sadness in his eyes. pippin stands and makes a move toward frodo merry grabs at his arm. the echo of boromir\\'s horn reaches aragorn, legolas, and gimli they are battling their way down the slopes towards the lake. aragorn desperately slashes his way towards boromir, felling uruk-hai in his path while legolas and gimli fight a rear guard action. many uruk-hai fall to boromir\\'s sword as he tries to protect merry and pippin. lurtz takes aim. a black arrow suddenly thuds into boromir\\'s chest. amazingly, boromir continues fighting, but another arrow and another, brings him to his knees. merry and pippin are scooped off their feet by uruk-hai. lurtz aims his bow at boromir\\'s heart suddenly aragorn charges at him, smashing the bow with his sword. they lock into a deadly battle. aragorn cuts lurtz down and races towards boromir, who lies slumped against a tree uruk-hai arrows sticking out of his chest. at least 20 dead uruk-hai lie heaped around boromir. his horn lies at his feet cloven in two. boromir holds aragorn\\'s gaze. aragorn places boromir\\'s sword in his hand. boromir\\'s fingers tighten around the hilt. on the lakeshore frodo stands in front of one of the elvish boats, the ring in his palm. a distraught sam running as hard as he can through the forest. frodo looks to the far side of the river the camera moves in on the ring. tears fall down frodo\\'s face. with renewed determination, frodo tucks the ring inside his vest pocket. the small figure of frodo pushing the elvish boat into the water sam bursts through the trees and runs toward the lake frodo is already paddling away. shore tears in his eyes the voice of sam carried on the wind. frodo whispers to himself sam looks at the water then at the boat. splash. frodo turns to see sam launching himself into the water. sam splashes hopelessly toward the boat. sam starts to go under, spluttering and coughing frodo drops his paddle and scrambles backwards in the boat. sam is underwater hands flailing helplessly as he sinks. frodo\\'s hand grasping sam\\'s frodo pulls a bedraggled and half drowned sam into the boat. frodo and sam look at each other, out of breath, tears and water streaming down both their faces. frodo starts to laugh through his tears the two friends hug. the two hobbits row through the water. looking down on swiftly flowing water boromir\\'s body slides under camera. he is lying in one of the boats, his arms across his chest his broken horn at his side. suddenly the boat drops away from camera as it plunges over the massive falls of rauros, disappearing into the vapor below. aragorn looks towards the far shore frodo and sam\\'s small boat can be seen lying on the distant riverbank as frodo and sam make off into the forest beyond. he doesn\\'t react. legolas turns and looks at aragorn. aragorn pulls a hunting knife out of his pack and straps it on. aragorn, legolas, and gimli disappear into the woods, following the uruk-hai trail. frodo and sam scramble onto a high ridge. a distant line of saw toothed mountains below a dark, oppressive sky. black volcanic smoke rises behind the mountains mordor. frodo looks at sam with great affection despite the grim outlook, sam is undeterred. the two hobbits setting off toward mordor. the end camera zooms in through the mountain and focuses on gandalf and the balrog on the bridge of khazad-dum. the balrog strikes down on gandalf with its flaming sword. gandalf parries the blow with glamdring, shattering the balrog\\'s sword. gandalf strikes his staff onto the bridge. as the balrog steps forward, the bridge collapses from under it and the demon plunges backward into the chasm. gandalf, exhausted, leans on his staff and watches the balrog fall then turns to follow the others. at the last minute, the flaming whip lashes up from the depths of the abyss and winds around gandalf\\'s ankle, dragging him over the edge. he clings onto the bridge but is straining to keep his grip. frodo rushes forward but boromir restrains him. gandalf loses his grip and falls into the chasm gandalf loses his grip and falls into the chasm calls after gandalf as he falls into the abyss gandalf falls after the balrog and grabs hold of his sword glamdring on his way down. as they continue to plunge into the depths, gandalf hacks away at the balrog even as it thrashes and bounces off the walls. they continue to plunge at great speed, sometimes with gandalf clinging to the horn of the demon. the battling pair then falls into an enormous cavern and plunges into the water. just then frodo awakens as if from a nightmare. lies back down. frodo and sam climbs over the rocky terrain emyn muil. they look into the distance at the mountain of fire. suddenly frodo feels and sees the eye zooming in on him. he gasps and pants as he backs away. clutches the ring by his chest and sits down, still panting. he then fumbles for his water bottle and takes a sip. he takes out a package of lembas bread from his packhe digs deeper into his pack sam shows another package. he then breaks off a piece and tosses it to frodo, and munches on a piece himself. smiles sam smiles back, and then looks ominously towards mordor. they continue trekking through difficult terrain, often huddling underneath their cloaks. looks around exasperated drops to a whisper nighttime frodo and sam are sleeping. a dark shape appears on top of the cliff. the creature gollum has appeared and is making his way down to the hobbits. gollum creeps closer and closer. gollum reaches out his hand towards the hobbits. suddenly the hobbits spring up, grab hold of gollum\\'s arms and pull him down. amidst the struggle, gollum wriggles loose and leaps onto frodo. as frodo falls back, the chain and ring around his neck is revealed and gollum jumps straight for the ring. sam tries to grab at him but is knocked away. gollum now jumps on top of frodo and tries to reach for the ring even as frodo grabs his hands and tries to push him away. gollum\\'s cheeks puff with exertion as he struggles with frodo, his enormous eyes fixed on the ring. sam grabs hold of gollum again and tears him away from frodo. gollum then turns around and bites sam on the shoulder, wriggles around and clasps his arms around sam\\'s neck and legs around his waist in a death grip. frodo unsheathes sting and holds it to gollum\\'s throat. menacingly slowly, gollum loosens his grip on sam and as the latter disentangles himself, gollum wails. in the next scene, gollum is being dragged with sam\\'s elvish rope around his neck, wailing and writhing in pain. sam tugs fiercely at the rope. gollum cries some more and collapses onto his back. sam turns to frodo in dismay. begging gollum backs away, frightened, and climbs onto a boulder sam jerks strongly at the rope as gollum tries to get away from him. he crashes onto the ground, choking. gollum lies panting and holding his throat. he backs away, frightened, as frodo approaches him. nods warily nods again frodo reaches out and takes the rope noose off gollum\\'s neck. gollum seems surprised and relieved. gollum scrambles off in the direction of morannon and the hobbits follow in his wake. a band of uruk-hai marches across the plain, with two hobbits bound to the backs of two uruk-hai. pippin tries to call to merry, who is unconscious with a gash on his right brow. he receives no response. suddenly, an uruk-hai puts up his hand and signals a stop. sniffs the air quietly to himself the uruk-hai quicken their pace. pippin struggles to reach his elven brooch with his teeth. he then tears it off his cloak and drops it onto the ground. a foot stomps onto the brooch but it remains unbroken and visible on the grass. aragorn is lying with his eyes closed and ear pressed to the ground, listening for the sound of footsteps. he looks up.he runs off. looks back at gimli and then runs after aragorn pauses in his steps and huffsruns after his companions. the three hunters run across rocks and plains, with aragorn in the lead, followed by legolas and gimli. from time to time, legolas looks back to make sure that gimli is keeping up. aragorn suddenly bends down to pick up an elven brooch from the ground. stops and turns to aragorn. runs off again gimli stumbles from behind some rocks and rolls to the ground panting the trackers come over a hill and pause as they gaze across the plains below. legolas runs ahead and looks out to the horizon. the tower of orthanc stands amidst the smoking caverns of isengard. saruman stands in his chamber, communicating with the dark lord through the palantir. view changes to the tower of barad-dur, with its huge orc armies on a bridge. camera pans upwards along the height of the tower of barad-dur until the flaming eye is in view. the trees around isengard are being ripped down, chopped up and used to feed huge furnaces. the caverns of isengard glow with the fires of industry, sounds of hammering fill the air and molten iron is poured into casts to forge weapons. saruman stands in the midst of a gathering of dunlanders. roars with approval they stomp off to destroy the villages of rohan as saruman stands coldly still among the stampede. a rohan village is in pandemonium as people try to escape the on-coming pillage. a woman with her hand on a horse calls out to her children. as morwen puts her onto the horse in front of her brother starts to cry a woman screams the children ride off. looks after them dunlanders and uruk-hai enter the village, burning everything in sights as the rohirrim scream and run in all directions. eothain and freda weep as they look back from a distance. a group of horsemen ride to edoras. eomer is in the lead, carrying a gravely wounded theodred. eowyn runs hastily up the stairs to the golden hall and enters a bedchamber. she runs to the bed. theodred seems to hear her call but is unable to respond. he has a bloody gash on the side of his head. eomer nods to eowyn in the direction of theodred\\'s torso. eowyn draws back the covers and upon seeing theodred\\'s fatal wound, her lips tighten and eyes close. she looks up to catch eomer\\'s eye. eomer and eowyn are speaking to theoden-king who sits motionless on his throne, wizened, and aged beyond his years. appears from the shadows. mumbles feeblygrima leans down close to the king. he drops a helmet onto the ground, which topples over to reveal the white hand of saruman. eomer grabs grima and pins him against a pillar. grima\\'s eyes flicks to right, watching eowyn as she walks by. eowyn stops to stare back for a moment before departing form the hall. eomer jerks grima again and clutches his hand around grima\\'s jaw. grima\\'s eyes look to the left and relax as eomer is suddenly pulled off grima by his thugs. the thugs punch eomer n the stomach uruk-hai and orcs continue to march across the plains with their hobbit captives, with aragorn, legolas, and gimli hot on their pursuits. they continue running over vast distances. the uruk-hai and orcs halt at nightfall, many panting with exertion. as the orcs and uruk-hai take their rest, pippin crawls over towards merry. opens his eyes a group of orcs chops down the trees nearby for firewood. low groans and rumbles start to emerge from the forest. looks towards the forest his eyes rest on the hobbits. shoves at the orcs the other orcs are getting restless. moves towards the hobbits with his blade drawn pippin and merry recoil in fright. ugluk jumps on the orc and cuts off his head, which bounces off the hobbit\\'s shoulders. the uruk-hai and orcs cheer and started tearing into the fresh meat, intestines flying, taking their eyes off the hobbits for a while. their hands still bound, the hobbits try to crawl away. suddenly a foot comes down on merry and pippin is turned onto his back. brandishing a blade in front of pippin\\'s face suddenly, a spear pierces the orc\\'s back. mayhem ensues as riders of rohan burst out from their hiding places and ambush the orcs. gestures for them to make their escape. the hobbits try to escape from the pandemonium to the forest, dodging bodies and stomping feet. suddenly pippin turns onto his face and looks up to a pair of thrashing hooves bearing down on him. the three hunters are still chasing after the uruk-hai. it is dawn. pauses and looks up camera pans over the rock and plains, alternating between the band of uruk-hai and the three hunters giving chase. the trackers hear the sound of horses. aragorn and company hide behind some boulders. a large group of horse-men appears, galloping quickly with their banners flying. aragorn comes out of hiding as they pass, followed by legolas and gimli. at a signal from eomer at the lead, the riders make a quick turn and head towards them, surrounding them in ever-tightening circles. as they stop, they point their long spears menacingly at them. eomer hands his staff to another rider, and gets off his horse. aragorn puts a hand on gimli\\'s shoulder. legolas, in a lightning fast move, points an arrow at eomer. the riders all point their spears closer at the travellers. after a tense moment, aragorn pushes down legolas\\' arm. takes off helmet the spears are withdrawn. points to a smoking pile in the distance. nods legolas puts a hand on gimli\\'s shoulder in grief. eomer turns and whistles. eomer puts on his helmet and gets back on his horse to the riders aragorn, legolas and gimli look on as the riders go off. they then ride towards the burning carcasses. gimli starts to shift through the smoldering pile, and pulls out a charred belt and dagger sheath. with his head bowed and eyes closed kicks a helmet and yellshe falls to his knees. aragorn looks to the side as some tracks catch his attention. flashback: pippin yells as he looks up at a pair of thrashing hooves bearing down on him. he rolls over, avoiding the hooves. aragorn starts to follow the tracks, with legolas and gimli behind him.  merry and pippin crawl frantically away from the battle. flashback: merry rubs his bonds furiously against the sharp edge of a weapon.aragorn holds up a broken length of thick rope. their hands freed, the hobbits run away from the battle scene, dodging under a horse and trying to stay out of harms way. as they flee, grishnak grabs pippin by his belt and clings on. pippin undoes his belt and grishnak is left holding it. they break into a run and then stop the three looks up into a dense and dark forest scene moves from the trackers into the nighttime chase of merry and pippin. the hobbits run into the fangorn, seeking to lose the pursuing orc. they collapse onto the ground, out of breath. looks around suddenly, grishnak appears from behind the trees, brandishing a blade. merry and pippin run and hide behind a tree. pippin and merry quickly scramble up a tree each. looks around and then sighs in relief. suddenly, merry is pulled by his legs and falls to the ground. grishnak leans over him with his menacing blade. merry tries to kick him off but to no avail. pippin looks down in horror but as he turns his head, he spots a pair of gleaming yellow eyes blinking in the tree he\\'s clinging to. the tree starts to move and groan. pippin loses his grip in fright and grabs at the air futilely as he falls. the tree catches him before he hits the ground. suddenly he senses something behind him and as he looks up, the tree stomps and squashes him onto the forest floor. merry tries to run away but is scooped by the tree. looks at the creatures in his hands stomps slowly through the forest. tightens his hold on the hobbits and squeezes them. merry and pippin whimpers in pain treebeard drops them on the ground and the hobbits look up at the white wizard. following gollum, frodo and sam reach the end of emyn muil and see that mordor is now closer. gollum jumps on a rock. frodo walks past, gollum shrinks as sam draws near. leaps after frodo, putting a wide berth between him and sam. sam\\'s foot slipped into muck. gollum looks back and gestures for the hobbits to follow. the marsh lands stretch for miles and miles as far as the eye can see. the hobbits and gollum appear as little specks. as the three pick their way gingerly though the marshes, they see faces floating in the water, still, rotting and pale, and flickering flames on the swamps. turns to face the hobbits. sam\\'s foot slips again into the water. frodo is drawn to one of the faces in elven armour. he stares at it intently, until suddenly its eyes open and frodo falls face-down into the water. frodo is in the water and sees many faces of the dead, no longer still but screaming and grasping, their rotten robes and hair flowing about their gruesome faces. their hands are reaching for him. suddenly he is grabbed from behind. frodo sputters and gasps for air as gollum pulls him out of the water. looks at gollum in perplexed gratitude and disbelief. crawls away runs to frodo\\'s side. frodo lies panting, staring after gollum nightfall sam is asleep but frodo is still awake. he is holding the ring in the palm of his hand and stroking it, mesmerized. suddenly he hears gollum. frodo quickly puts the ring back inside his shirt. he looks up to see gollum crouching away from him, stroking the centre of his palm moves over and crouches in front of gollum looks up slowly. suddenly, the piercing cries of the nazgul are heard overhead suddenly frodo feels the pain of the nazgul\\'s sword piercing him and the call of the ring. images of the ringwraiths come to him in flashes. frodo continues to clutch at the ring on his chest, immobilized. sam drags frodo across to hide beneath some bramble bushes. the nazgul appears, tightening his hold on the reins. camera then shows him riding a fell beast, swooping down across the marsh lands. chilling screams of the nazgul fill the air. a loud screech from the nazgul flying high above the marshes. cowering frodo feels the call of the ring and gropes for his necklace. sam sees this

he falls. aragorn tries to let go of the warg but finds his wrist tangled with the saddle straps. he tries unsuccessfully to disentangle himself and is dragged closer and closer to the edge of a cliff at great speed. the warg runs right off the cliff and they both disappear over the edge. the battle is winding down as the rohirrim finish off the last few wargs and orcs. looking around they come near to the cliff and hear sharku wheezing and laughing standing over the dying orc coughlaughs evilly looks towards the edge of the cliff, and grabs sharku sharku chortles and dies. legolas looks down at sharku\\'s fist and finds the evenstar pendant. he takes it, runs to the edge of the cliff and looks down to see the great drop and rushing waters below, with no sign of aragorn. gimli comes to stand beside him. to his men legolas turns to theoden, an expression of perplexed anger on his face. puts a hand on legolas\\' shoulder he leaves legolas and gimli to stare down at the river. the

some dark dry substances into a vessel. grima is holding a lit candle in his hand. as he steps closer to the vessel, saruman takes hold of grima\\'s hand and pushes the candle away from the vessel firmly. he walks away towards the balcony. following saruman both of them came onto the balcony of the tower. grima suddenly sees and hears the enormous armies laid out below in neat rows and is astounded and awed. he continues to hold the extinguished candle aloft as he gapes at the vast army below. a horn is sounded, announcing the appearance of saruman. a loud cheer is heard from the army. saruman raises a hand. the army cheers and roars. the camera keeps zooming out from the balcony over the incredible size of saruman\\'s army, past uruk-hai, spears, and banners and yet more uruk-hai. the camera focuses back on saruman who then raises his hands in the air the army cheers and roars even louder. sneers a tear flows down grima\\'s cheek. the uruk-hai army began their march to helm\\'s

the monument, veiled and in black. still veiled in black, arwen is walking alone through the deserted woods of lothlorien. tuning to arwen the vision ends and arwen weeps with sadness and fear. elrond comes to sit beside his daughter and raises a hand to her cheek. crying and moving into her father\\'s embrace elves, cloaked and carrying a lantern each, are setting off from rivendell on their journey to the west. elrond looks on as arwen leaves with them. arwen turns back to look at her father one last time before she departs. elrond continues to stare after her with an expression of

raw fish. gollum turns round at frodo\\'s voice. frodo gestures for gollum to follow him. with the fish between his teeth, gollum follows frodo warily. suddenly he looks up in alarm and is caught by rangers. wails a black cloth is brought over gollum\\'s head. frodo stares after them with a stricken expression as faramir leads gollum and his men away. back in the cave, gollum is thrown down to

the crowd.he sees aragorn.he hugs aragorn. gimli gestures to the hall. as aragorn makes his way in, he runs into legolas who stands waiting. they smile. legolas pauses and looks at aragorn\\'s wounds. to the side, eowyn sees aragorn and smiles joyously and with relief. legolas takes aragorn\\'s hand and gives the evenstar pendant. aragorn looks at the evenstar and claps legolas on the shoulder.

off. theoden stands at the gate of helm\\'s deep, speaking to aragorn, legolas and gimli. gimli seems miffed. legolas claps a hand on gimli\\'s shoulder as he follows aragorn and theoden back in. draws close to aragorn he walks away, calling out orders cutting him off to the soldiers men rush to prepare for battle as flocks of carrion crows circle overhead. treebeard walks through the forest carrying merry and pippin. he comes to a clearing and stops. merry and pippin turns round as they hear movement from the forest around them. they see many more ents like treebeard gathering. merry licks his lips in anticipation. back at helm\\'s deep, the women and children are being led into the caves. old men and young lads are being drafted for war. the women and children say their tearful and reluctant farewells as their fathers, husbands and sons are led away by soldiers. in the armoury, weapons are being distributed. aragorn picks up a battered sword, looks at it and tosses it back. the men around them fell silent. legolas speaks to aragorn. he pauses and then walks away. legolas makes as if to go after him. puts a hand on legolas in the hall puts armour onto theoden the villagers are handed their weapons. an oversized helmet is placed on a wide-eyed boy. another stares at the axe that he is handed with frightened eyes. another child wearing oversized chain mail takes up a huge shield. theoden stands inside the main hall of the keep, his back to the entrance where a bright white light is streaming through. everyone is getting ready for war at the battlements. aragorn is sitting on the steps. he sees a young lad in armour holding a sword looking around nervously. aragorn gives the battered sword a few swings. he hands the sword back to haleth and leans close to him, putting a hand on his shoulder. back at the armoury, aragorn dons his battle gear. his sword is handed to him as he reaches for it. he nods and accepts the sword from legolas. they smile and clap one another on the shoulders. they look at gimli as he walks up to them, struggling with his chain mail. he drops the bundle and the chain mail lands with its length right to the floor. aragorn and legolas bite back smiles. just then, a horn sounds in the background they run out to the battlements. the guards look down in wonderment. to another guard an army of lothlorien elves march up the causeway into the hornburg. they are led by haldir. the rohirrim soldiers look upon them in wonderment and delight as they pass. he looks up to see aragorn, legolas and gimli running down the steps, and smiles he bowshe grabs haldir in a huge embrace. initially stunned, haldir hugs him back lightly. legolas and haldir clasp each other on the shoulder. turning to theoden men and elves are in their positions on the battlements of helm\\'s deep. the sounds of a marching army move closer and closer. the women and children in the caves hear the sounds overhead and are frightened. mothers draw their children close and try to sooth crying babies. the men and elves look out into the darkness, lit by the thousands of torches carried by the huge advancing uruk-hai army and the light bouncing off their armour. with a row of elf archers, gimli is standing beside legolas behind a wall, only the top of his helmet visible. grumbling and straining to look above the wall. legolas smirks. aragorn approaches and stands beside them thunder sounds and lightning flashes, revealing the sea of approaching uruk-hai. the marching and thumping grows louder and louder. lightning flashes and it begins to rain. while the uruk-hai army continues to march at the fortress, an uruk-hai leader steps on a rock outcrop. aragorn is giving commands to the elf warriors. the uruk-hai leader raises his swords and commands his army to stop with a terrifying animalic cry. the uruks stop and growl in anticipation of the upcoming battle and slaughter jumping and straining to see looks at gimli with a grin laughs good-naturedly the uruk leader cries out once, encouraging the uruk-hai to start roaring and thumping their spears furiously.the women and children in the caves huddle together in fear. suddenly, aldor, the old man next to haleth, loses his grip and releases his arrow prematurely, shooting an uruk-hai in the neck. the uruk-hai army stop their roaring and thumping. with a hollow groan, the uruk that was shot collapsed to the ground. the other uruk-hai bare their teeth and roar with anger. with a cry, the uruk-hai leader thrusts his weapon in the air and the uruk-hai army starts charging. the elves notch their arrow and aim. arrows rain down on the uruk-hai below, killing many. to the men more arrows are released. but the uruk-hai army keep advancing, with more replacing those fallen. impatiently the uruk-hai start to load ladders onto the walls, pushing them up with their long spears. the elves draw their blades in preparation for combat. the first ladders are almost reaching the walls with big nasty uruk berserkers on top of them. close combat begins as the uruk-hai climb over the wall. holding up two fingers outragedhe turns to a uruk just climbing over the wall, whacking it in the groin with his axe and killing it as it falls. fires two arrows the ent moot is still in progress. the ents sway a little as they continue to deliberate. merry and pippin are sitting a distance away. suddenly, treebeard nods and turns to the hobbits. gesturing long pause with his eyes closed. angles his head in query impatiently waving a hand merry and pippin roll their eyes in disgruntlement. gimli is standing on the wall between two ladders, hacking away at uruk-hai as they come up camera pans over the uruk-hai below and turns to the causeway. a group of uruk-hai is advancing on the causeway towards the gate in tortoise formation, using their broad shields to block off attacks. directs the elf archers to aim at the uruk-hai column. the elf archers release their arrows. the uruk-hai at the sides are shot and fall down the causeway. but the column keeps advancing. at the bottom of the deeping wall, two spiky bombs are lodge in the sluice gate. the rest opens a path and an uruk-hai carrying a torch starts to run towards the sluice gate. aragorn spots the uruk-hai. legolas shoots the uruk-hai in the shoulder but the latter keeps going legolas shoots the uruk again. it stumbles and then throws it self and the torch at the bombs. an enormous explosion is set off, blowing away a large part of the wall. rock, debris and bodies are thrown up. aragorn is also thrown back by the force of the explosion and on the ground, knocked out. theoden looks on in shock as the uruk-hai streams in past the deeping walls. gimli sees the uruk-hai charging in with aragorn in their path. with a cry, he jumps down from the wall and lands on the uruk-hai army, taking them out as he stands. he is soon overpowered. aragorn gets up and sees gimli falling. he yells to the elves behind him the arrows take out the first group of uruk-hai coming through the hole in the wall. aragorn leads the elves in a charge towards the uruk-hai streaming in. he rushes to gimli\\'s side and picks him up. at the top of the battlements, legolas grabs a shield and sends it sliding across the ground. he then hops onto it and surfs down the steps, releasing three arrows as he goes, and kicking the shield to stab an uruk-hai as he lands at the bottom. at the ent moot the ents look at one another, taken back merry is putting on his jacket. pippin approaches him slowly looking into the distance.turns to pippin and puts a hand on his shoulder pippin looks after merry as he walks away. haldir nods and turns back. gimli is being carried away, kicking and struggling as he goes protesting haldir hacks at a few uruk as he turns towards the gate. suddenly, he is stabbed in his arm. and looks down as his wound in seeming disbelief. an uruk-hai comes up from behind him unnoticed and slices him on the neck. as haldir goes down, he looks around him and sees his kin fallen among dead uruk-hai. sees haldir fallinghe runs up the steps to haldir\\'s side and catches him and he collapses. haldir\\'s head rolls back, his eyes empty and unseeing. aragorn bows his head in grief. then with a cry, he jumps onto a ladder and swings down to the ground, killing as he goes. drawing his sword theoden and his commanders come to the gate, which is under heavy attack. the uruk-hai are knocking down the gate and hacking through the broken wood. theoden stabs at an uruk-hai and receives a lance in his shoulder, blocked by his armour. grimacing in pain, theoden continues to stab at the uruk until led away by gamling. runs up and stabs away at the uruk-hai through the broken gate aragorn and gimli slip out a side exit and stand on a ledge just to the side of the main gate. aragorn peeks over, seeing the large band of uruk-hai storming the gate. gimli takes a peek and then steps back. mumbles aragorn nods slowly and then turns to grab the dwarf. gimli stays aragorn\\'s hand he tosses gimli to the head of the causeway and then leaps over. making quick work of killing the uruk-hai on the other side of the gate men are bracing the gate with wood and nails. aragorn and gimli continue to fight off the uruk-hai just outside. meanwhile

firing two arrows into the uruk-hai army as he goes. treebeard is walking through the forest, carrying merry and pippin. the hobbits look dejected. pippin suddenly looks up with a gleam in his eyes. treebeard comes to a stop. faramir and company draws close to osgiliath. with tears in his eyes faramir hesitates for a moment. he presses them on frodo and sam are pushed on towards osgiliath treebeard, merry and pippin come to the southern edge of the forest. he sees the desolated landscape of tree stumps that used to be forested grounds with tears in his eyeshis gaze turns to the treeless isengard and its smoking caverns he lets out a ferocious roar that echoes through the forest merry and pippin turn around as they hear rumbles from the forest. they see many ents emerging and marching towards them osgiliath is still under siege as faramir and company arrives, dodging arrows and falling rocks. frodo suddenly seems stricken frodo sees that sam is speaking to him but he hears nothing. his senses are overcome. sam breaks away as they are being led away. a boulder crashes into a tower overhead and shatters it. suddenly, frodo\\'s eyes roll up and he stares at faramir strangely. in a faraway voice looking uphe grabs the hobbits and thrusts them into a corner.to his men banners of the white hand are flying from the battlements of helm\\'s deep. the hornburg is overrun with uruk-hai. theoden and company are in the hall of the keep. carrying a table with legolas to shore up the door of the hall in the glittering caves, the women and children cry in fear as they hear the battering ram banging on the door. there is no answer. pause a light of determination shines in his eyes aragorn looks up at a window to see faint light streaming through. he recalls gandalf\\'s words. gimli runs up the steps to the horn of helm hammerhand he mounts his horse and puts on his helmet. the sound of the horn rumbles through helm\\'s deep as gimli blows with gusto. theoden leads the charge out of the keep into the hornburg, slashing away at the uruk-hai as they go. without pause, they storm out of the gate and down the causeway, right into the column of waiting uruk-hai. in the midst of battle, aragorn looks east and sees a white rider against the rising sun coming up from behindhe raises a hand riders move up behind eomer. looking to the east the rohirrim and the white rider charge down the slope. half the uruk-hai army turns to face the challenge, bearing their spears down towards the riders. as the riders draw closer, the sun rises behind them, momentarily blinding the uruk-hai who raise the hands and spears to shield their eyes. the riders crash right into the uruk-hai and engage them in battle. the ents are stomping over isengard, swinging their huge limbs, throwing and stamping on orcs and rolling huge boulders over the ground. an ent is pulled down with chains by some orcs, who immediately jump on and hacks away at his wooden limbs. saruman rushes out onto the balcony of orthanc and stares at the pandemonium in incredulity. merry and pippin also throws stones at orcs, their aims true. two ents rock a wooden structure and push it over into the caverns below, smashing against the rock. some orcs fire flamed-tipped arrows at an ent, setting him on fire. saruman continues to look about from his balcony, helpless. some ents are now breaking away at a dam. the dam is broken and saruman looks up to see the river rushing down the slope towards isengard, washing away orcs and wooden structures in its path. the hobbits tighten their hold on top of treebeard treebeard braces himself against the flood. as the water rushes over isengard, an ent rushes in and thrusts his burning body into the water. the water rushes into the caverns, washing away the bridges, mechanisms and structures within. frodo walks slowly away from the safe corner. gondorian rangers are still running about, defending their stations. slow motion frodo walks up some stairs and stands on a bridge. a nazgul on a fell beast emerges in front of him. frodo stares at the nazgul, fixated. feeling the call of the ring, he holds it up. faramir watches the unfolding tableau from below. as frodo moves to put the ring on his finger and the nazgul flies closer and closer, sam runs up and knocks frodo over. faramir releases an arrow and shoots the fell beast. frodo and sam roll down the stairs. as they come to a stop at the bottom, frodo holds sam in a death grip, yells and points sting at his throat, his eyes livid with madness and anger that someone would try to take the ring away. with tears running down his face the madness fades and recognition returns to frodo\\'s eyes. he realises what he nearly did and is overcome. stumbling backwards, he collapses against a wall and sting falls to the ground with a clang. sam gets up slowly. slowly and with despair getting up slowlyhe stands and leans against a wall, looking out into the distance.images of the riders winning the battle against the uruk-hai at helm\\'s deep he raises his sword with a victorious cry the women and children welcome the men as they return. eowyn runs up to

corner, even gollum seems moved. faramir walks over and comes to kneel in front of frodo sam shakes the ranger\\'s hand from his shoulder. frodo looks up at faramir with gladness. over in the realm of rohan, gandalf, theoden and company ride to the top of a slope, looking towards the mountain of fire in the distance. frodo and sam are walking through the woods, away from osgiliath. frodo turns to

the ring as gollum peers at them with gleaming eyes. sam stirs, looks at frodo. frodo shakes his head. the ground suddenly quivers, as a rolling, rumbling noise echoes down the valley. sam shoots gollum a hostile look and turns back to rummage in his knapsack. he holds up a piece of dried lembas bread to frodo. frodo looksa t sam questioningly. frodo says nothing. frodo and sam follow gollum as he leads them on the wining, torturous path clambering through bracken and over jagged rocks. gandalf leads aragorn, legolas, theoden and gimli through dark woodland. the moving forest of fangorn opens before them creating an avenue of trees, which allows them access along the old isengard road. a thick, humid mist fills the forest. the foest separates ahead, revealing the ruins of isengard. all about, the great stone wall is cracked and splintered into countless jagged shards. two small hobbits are sitting on the smashed wall merry and pippin. spread before them is a feast of breads, meats and wine. they puff on long pipes as they lie back in the sun. merry cuts pippin off before he can respond in kind. gandalf, aragorn, legolas and gimli stare at the sight before them. gandalf leads the company through the flotsam and jetsam which floats upon the muddied waters surrounding the tower treebeard, the giant ent, strides towards them, alarming all but gandalf. gandalf stares up the long length of the dark tower. the old ent nods his head wisely. pippin, his eye caught by something lying in the water the muddy waters glowing wit a golden light. aragorn turns as, quick as a

him, smiling at the floorshow. gandalf turns quickly to aragorn. gandalf watches his friend\\'s face seeking reassurance. frodo and sam lie asleep amidst scrubby bushes near a stagnant pool. smeagol lies nearby, muttering in his sleep. smeagol wakes suddenly, shaking, his face drenched in sweat, eyes wide in horror. smeagol\\'s features suddenly transform into the malevolent face of gollum. smeagol casts a quick glance over his shoulder to the sleeping figures of frodo and sam as he clambers off his rock silently sidling towards the edge of a stagnant pool. smeagol stares into the murky depths of the water. the surface ripples as the face of gollum appears as smeagol\\'s reflection. smeagol choking deagol fingers locked tight around his throat. sam his eyes flicker open. sudden sam

the golden hall, oblivious to the chill wind they look out across the sleeping city to the looming mountain range beyond -. dark clouds mark the sky. legolas looks at aragorn realisation in his face. pippin he is awake. he sits up anxious, fidgety. suddenly he hops out of bed and creeps towards the sleeping form of gandalf. a sleeping gandalf lies with eyes wide open. but pippin is undeterred. merry sits up, a worried look on his face. with quick stealth, pippin lifts the wrapped palantir from gandalf\\'s grasp. pippin unwraps the palantir and as merry looks on horrified, he gazes intently into it. as pippin lays his hands on the crystal, a sickly pale light slowly spreads from the glass ball onto pippin\\'s face his eyes widen. on the steps of the golden hall, legolas turns to aragorn pippin suddenly starts to hyperventilate he staggers backwards, palantir held rigidly before him. the great eye of sauron seems to leap from the fire pippin is bathed in the fiery red light. pippin sinks to his knees, his mouth open in a soundless scream he falls backwards, powerless to release the fiery globe. gandalf wakes with a start. just as aragorn enters, and wrenches the palantir from pippin\\'s hands pippin falls to the floor aragorn spins away, reeling backwards, the palantir falling from his hands. the palantir rolls across the floor, causing everyone in the room to cower back.

minas tirith. a silhouetted figure appears in the distance and moves towards the child the boy runs to the figure. arwen watches as the figure holds out its arms - swinging the laughing child into the

white face whitening in the rising sun. upon its out- thrust knee is the guarded city minas tirith. with seven walls of white stone, so strong and old that it seems to have been not built, minas tirith looks carven by giants out of the bones of the earth. suddenly the sun climbs over the eastern hills, and sends forth a shaft of sunlight that gleams against th e face of the city. the tower of

kings carved in cold stone. gandalf strides down the hall, with pippin following obediently behind. at the far end, upon a dais of many steps, sits a large, empty throne and on the wall behind is the image of a flowering white tree set in gems. at the foot of the dais, in a small stone chair, sits an old man, gazing at his lap denethor - the lord steward of condor. denethor does not look up as

from their cover scampering in the shadows towards minas morgul. frodo he looks up at the hideous statues. his senses start reeling. frodo and sam look aghast at the sight of a narrow, near- vertical

which spans both sides of osgiliath they head straight towards minas tirith. aragorn, theoden, eomer, merry, legolas and gimli gallop into a vast camp beneath the cover of trees teeming with men, horses and tents. theoden acknowledges grimbold, a marshall of rohan, as he passes by a group of soldiers. theoden smiles grimly as he rides on. aragorn joins theoden on a bluff overlooking the encampment below. thousands of men and horses. smoke from many small camp-fires has filled the valley with a twilight haze. aragorn turns to theoden. theoden realising what aragorn is saying - no matter the numbers he must commit to war by the morning. theoden nods. the horses whinny loudly in the distance theoden looks up at the mountain which looms behind them. horses rearing in terror as rohan soldiers try to quieten them. legolas and gimli move through the camp. legolas looking at a group of rohan soldiers they sit quiet and hunched no-one speaking. legolas looking toward eomer who is unsaddling his horse. gimli\\'s eyes travel to a row of ancient standing stones that mark the entrance to a road leading away from the encampment and into the mountain. aragorn stands before the road as though transfixed before him a horse whinnies and pulls at his ropes nervously. a ghostly figure seems to emerge from the gloom aragorn starts in fright as. aragorn stares down at the little dwarf. aragorn casts another look back at the ancient standing stones before following gimli. all is quiet in the encampment. eowyn kneels before merry, adjusting his helmet strap. merry exhales -

evenstar falls from her fingers at that moment, aragorn wakes, his sword quickly in his hand a guard stands in the doorway. aragorn hurries towards theoden\\'s tent. - theoden looks up as aragorn enters. theoden bows slightly to the hooded figure and leaves, shooting aragorn a strange look as he goes. the figure stands and pulls back the hood to reveal elrond. elrond\\'s face is etched with pain. elrond\\'s eyes fall to the evenstar which hangs around aragorn\\'s neck. aragorn looks at elrond in shock. a fleet of black sails moving along a silver ribbon of water . elrond hesitates a beat. a sudden wind rushes through the tent, lifting hangings, scattering maps, knocking over goblets. as aragorn looks at elrond, an image flashes in his mind\\'s eye the ghostly figure on the dimholt road. aragorn looks at elrond in shock. aragorn\\' s eyes fall to a plain black scabbard, which elrond draws from beneath his robes. elrond\\' s long white fingers draw the hilt of a sword from the scabbard to reveal a elven sword glints in the firelight. aragorn takes the sword staring at it in wonder. aragorn draws the long blade from its sheath. elrond stares hard at aragorn. a heavy silence hangs in the room. aragorn re-sheathes the sword. as aragorn readies brego for leaving eowyn approaches her temper barely held in check. aragorn looks over his shoulder at her. aragorn looks at her sadly, not wanting to hurt her. eowyn steps back at though struck she watches stricken as aragorn leaves. aragorn leads his horse through the tents towards the dimholt road. a light flares ahead.of him. a short figure steps out of the shadows pipe in hand. aragorn looks at gimli - grateful for his courage but determined to go alone. aragorn shakes his head, smiling his acceptance.

aragorn, legolas and gimli rohan soldiers emerge from their tents, crestfallen to see aragorn leave. aragorn, legolas and gimli disappear into the shadows of the mountains. the rohan soldiers murmur among themselves, \"what\\'s happening?\", \"where\\'s he going?\" theoden as he moves forward. theoden looks at eowyn who stands as if turned to stone she is looking up at a lightening sky the quiet before the men depart for war. eowyn turns to the king her face a blank she speaks without emotion. theoden moves towards her, taking up her hand. eowyn slowly lifts her head. theoden lifts eowyn faces to look into her eyes. aragorn, legolas and gimli make their way up a. gloomy canyon, shadowed by black fir trees. the shadowed ridges of the dwimorberg mountain rise before them. silence surrounds them, there are no birds, no wind. only the ominously muffled thud of their horses hooves on the dank fir- needles. \\' before them, at the root of the mountain, a sheer wall of rock towers. within the walls, a creepy dark door gapes like a mouth of night. signs and figures are carved above its wide arch. at that moment a chill wind seems to rush out of the doorway aragorn stares into the blackness, his hair blowing wildly. the horses rear and\\'buck\\'in terror, turning and galloping away. aragorn walking into the blackness. legolas quickly follows swallowed by the darkness. gimli

amongst the soldiers. denethor looks down at faramir\\'s unconscious body. pippin has run to faramir and bends towards him. denethor slowly turning away walking as if in a trance. denethor has reached the edge of the courtyard he stares in shocked disbelief at the vista spread out below a full view of the orc army from the top of minas\\'tirith. 75,000 orcs are spread out across the pelennor fields like a sea of black ants. trolls load the catapults with rocks. battering rams and siege towers are hauled on chains. thousands of flickering torches give the army the look of a moving city in the

in contempt. suddenly. 9 nazgul dive out of the dim sky, clad in battle armour. soldiers throw themselves down as the nazgul zoom overhead, emitting their piercing shrieks. gondorian soldiers run for shelter in panic, covering their ears. pippin cowering. mighty wooden catapults positioned within the walls of minas tirith are fired. the nazgul circle low over the city, like vultures seeking doomed

falling masonry. too late. the towers reach the walls, their doors crashing down, releasing orcs directly onto the lower levels. as the orc swarm from the tower, gandalf realises pippin has come down from the citadel. pippin looks on stunned, as a huge orc leaps towards him gandalf intercepts the beast, striking him with his staff. gandalf welds his staff, cutting through the attacking orc with ease behind him, an orc prepares to cut down gandalf pippin instinctively slashes his sword at him. gandalf turns on pippin, smiling despite himself. out of black swirling battle. smoke crawls an iron monster. a massive wheeled battering ram . 60 feet high and 150 feet long pushed by 20 huge mountain trolls a massive iron head, cast in the likeness of a snarling wolf. this is grond the battering ram from hell. the ore are chanting as the beast is wheeled closer and closer to the gates. gandalf blanching at the sight of this crawling iron monster\"\\'. gollum leads frodo up a long ravine between columns of torn and weathered rock. ahead is a great grey wall, a last huge mass of mountain- stone and in the shadows at the base of the towering rock lies a tunnel. frodo reacts to the foul stench coming out of the black hole. smeagol sensing his plan unravelling. everything depends on frodo going inside the tunnel frodo stares into the darkness. gollum, his sparse oily hair hanging like rank weed over his hooded eyes. drawing a deep breath, frodo follows gollum into the tunnel. frodo nearly gags they continue on, deep into the dark tunnel frodo is feeling his way in the dark, following the sound ,of gollum\\'s scampering , ,. frodo follows the sound of gollum\\'s voice. he is very tired. frodo cannot see gollum in the murky tunnel. gollum is nowhere to be seen only his voice echoes back down the labyrinth of tunnels. frodo freezes. no answer, no echo, not even a tremor in the air. frodo realises with horror that gollum has deserted him. frodo breathing hard passing all manner of creatures, trussed up in evil web-like material. a bubbling hiss can be heard there is a creaking as some great jointed thing moves with slow purpose in the dark. frodo begins to run in blind panic. sam stumbles blindly down the ancient stairs, reckless and uncaring, his face pale and devastated. sam\\'s foot slips. suddenly, as if the ground has given way beneath him, sam is slipping and sliding dangerously out of control. sam thudding into a large rock, which saves him. from tumbling headlong over the precipice. something catches sam\\'s eye he stares, barely breathing. a package of lembas bread. sam looking back up the long steep stair. frodo is running blindly he falls, trapped in the sticky substance which clings to him. as he lays on the ground, unable to move, a voice comes to him as if froma distant-,, memory. frodo fumbles in his jacket, fear growing in him he pulls out the glass phial - his gift from galadriel - he holds it aloft. the phial flickers kindles into a silver flame - a bright radiant starlight. shelob the spider hisses at the light. two great clusters of many-windowed eyes protrude from her bulbous head. her legs are bent, with a 12 foot span and hairs that stick out like steel spines. her huge, swollen body, a vast bloated bag, sways and sags between her legs. her age-old black hide is knobbly and pitted, blotchy with livid marks but her belly underneath is pale and luminous. shelob beats the air with her forelegs. calling up all his remaining strength and resolution, frodo forces his legs to move he backs away - keeping his eyes on shelob. shelob crawls slowly towards him then, with sudden . hideous speed, she attacks. she lashes out with her front legs frodo is flung back the glass phial clatters to the tunnel floor, casting an eerie low light. shelob squats above frodo, her eye clusters fidgeting with hideous delight, gloating over a prey trapped beyond all hope of escape. suddenly. frodo draws sting. he slashes wildly at the giant spider hewing off the tip of a leg. shelob spasms a wild blur of thrashing legs. frodo leaps to his feet and runs - not even pausing to pick up the phial of light. with frodo as he careers blindly down narrow tunnels, gasping in the choking air looking back over his shoulder for any sign of shelob. frodo sees the tunnel exit ahead. just as he runs straight into a great cobweb. gollum on the other side of the web. frodo as he slashes wildly with sting. the shining blade of sting as it hacks through the fibrous strands. they whip and snap back into frodo\\'s face as he cuts himself free. back up the tunnel - lit by the light of galadriel - shelob\\'s heaving shadow approaches. gollum watches in mounting disbelief as sting slashes through the web disbelief turns to fear as shelob gets closer and closer, gollum quickly turns and bolts. frodo hacks at the web and with a last desperate lunge, frees himself sting is caught in the web frodo leaves the sword and throws himself through a narrow crevice. frodo stumbles out of shelob\\'s lair tumbling onto cold rock. frodo covered in cobwebs, wild-eyed and drenched in sweat - h e looks up as gollum lunges at him. gollum and frodo fight rolling on the ground towards the edge of a precipice. frodo\\'s fingers squeeze tighter around gollum\\'s throat. frodo has a sudden moment of self realisation and releases gollum, horrified at his violence. gollum cowering back coughing and spluttering. frodo looking at smeagol, in shock, he gets to his feet. smeagol stares at frodo in disbelief in a fury he lunges at frodo who falls backwards, dangerously close to the edge of the precipice - gollum tumbles over frodo\\'s body and falls to the bottom of the ravine. frodo, overcome with exhaustion, stumbles down the steep stairs of cirith ungol he is full of remorse at his treatment of sam. frodo falls t o his knees -- frodo lands on soft green grass. sun drenched of trees of fields of lothlorien hazy galadriel walking towards him, bare-foot on the gr ss a galadriel leans down towards frodo, offering her hand for a beat, frodo stares at her torn, not wanting to go on, wanting to lie down but he knows what he must do. frodo as he is lifted to his feet. frodo - once again in the dark, rank, tunnels of the pass of cirith ungol he goes on. flaming missiles rain down on the city. a deep boom. grond thuds against the minas tirith gate sending a - vibration running through the city. gandalf, on shadowfax, leads several hundred gondorian foot soldiers down through the streets. pippin watches as faramir\\'s unconscious body is carried on the stretcher by denethor\\'s servants lead by denethor it has the atmosphere of a funeral. an iron door creaks open faramir\\'s procession enters a wide vaulted chamber. the lantern lig ht throws great shadows upon the shrouded walls of a wide vaulted chamber. row upon row of marble tombs are visible in the dim light. upon each tomb lies a sleeping form, carved in stone, hands folded. denethor speaks in a hushed voice. the servants place faramir\\'s unconscious body on a stone table in the centre of the chamber. they stand, heads bowed as mourners beside a bed of death. denethor turns to his servants. booomm the gate splinters under grond\\'s mighty weight behind the gates the gondorian foot soldiers are fearful. gandalf rallies the line of bowmen as they wait in front of the great doors their courage wavering with each crashing b ow l . suddenly the fearsome head protrudes into the minas tirith. within moments the gate is smashed and giant cave trolls enter into the first circle of minas tirith, under the archway that no enemy had ever passed. rows of archers fire off a volley of arrows but the trolls continue to smash the foot soldiers with their giant clubs orcs swarm through the opening and the pitched, hand-to- hand battle spills into flames and blackened, smouldering buildings through the streets of minas tirith. with a roar, gandalf leads a counter attack on shadowfax, followed by several hundred gondorian foot \" \" soldiers. thousands of orcs swarm in through the city gates the first level is breached. frodo staggers through the pass of cirith ungol the weight of the ring, dragging at his neck. he moves forward, fueled by a grim resolve. frodo starts climbing a stone staircase that climbs through a narrow pass tall peaks rise on either side, like pillars holding up a sagging sky. frodo stays close to the rock wall, masked by shadows. behind frodo, shelob appears. with hideous stealth, she follows frodo. frodo slowly climbing the stone stairs his gaze and concentration on the orc tower. behind him, shelob lurches into a horrible scuttle down the sheer rock face. frodo suddenly senses the lurking malice he spins around before he can react, shelob viciously stabs frodo in the neck with her monstrous abdominal stinger. frodo instantly goes limp shelob\\'s legs catch him as he around him. with falls she quickly starts weaving cobwebs great dexterity, she tumbles the little hobb it over and over in her legs, binding him in web from head to toe. suddenly the razor sharp edge of a sword comes into shot. samwise gamgee stands before the giant spider - sting clutched in one hand, the shining phial in the other. shelob hisses at sam dropping frodo he rolls down the stairs in his web cocoon. sam moves forward, a fell light in his normally friendly eyes sam swings the small sword slashing upward. sam ducks inside the arch of her legs and stabs sting into one of her eye clusters. shelob screams, her mandibles thrashing wildly, green ooze trickling from her wounded eye. with hind legs, shelob picks sam off the ground and tosses him backwards. sam lands heavily and shelob pounces. shelob heaves the great bag of her belly high above sam\\'s head. as she splays her legs to drive her huge bulk down on him, sam lifts the elven blade above his head, holding it with two hands. sting slides into shelob\\'s soft underbelly. a shudder runs through her. heaving up. again, she wrenches herself away from the pain her limbs writhing beneath her. jerking and quivering, shelob crawls to her hole, leaving a trail of green-yellow slime. she squeezes down the hole and disappears the sound of her bubbling misery fades. sam races to frodo. sam rips cobwebs away from frodo\\'s head his face is deathly pale. frodo\\'s pale, lifeless face. frodo\\'s head lolls lifelessly in sam\\'s arms. frodo staring, unmoving. sam lays his face on frodo\\'s chest weeping softly. sting\\'s blade glows blue. tramping feet approach clinking metal harsh shouts. sam looks up looks back down frodo. sam looks up at the orc tower and then at sting which is glowing blue. orcs approach - sam must make a decision. a small party of orcs and uruk-hai heading down the stairs from the watch tower shagrat leads the uruk-hai, and gorbag leads the orcs. gorbag spies frodo\\'s body. gorbag peer curiously at frodo as he leans down and pokes at frodo\\'s lifeless body. the orcs grunt as they lift frodo and carry him back towards the watch tower. orc laughter frodo is carried up the steep stairs  from the shadows pippin watches, aghast, as faramir is lain on a funeral pyre. denethor kisses faramir\\'s sweating, fevered brow. bundles of dried firewood are being stacked around

of mount milldolluin, they dimly echo - war horns of the west rohan has come. gothmog turns at the sound of the distant horns. minas tirith lies less than a mile away, down a gentle slope. over 50,000

lances in readiness. eowyn, her arm around merry before her. merry looks on in shock. as theoden rides past the ranks of soldiers he runs his lance along their spears the noise echoes through the

to engulf denethor. gandalf pulls pippin to safety they look in horror as. suddenly. denethor lurches off the pyre. now a screaming, unguided ball of flame, he runs across the chamber, disappearing out of the door. denethor runs across the white court atop minas tirith and plummets straight over the 700 foot sheer drop into the flaming city below. denethor\\'s death plunge to the rohirrim

the spectral warriors swarm into the flank of the qrc army. with a raging blood-lust, the undead climb over the top of each other to try and reach the enemy, creating a kind of.rolling mountain of ghouls that sweep all before them away. the orcs have no defence as their weapons cannot make contact with the ghosts. merry on the ground he looks around to see the witch-king standing over eowyn, pulling her to her feet. merry driving his sword into the back of the witch- king\\'s knee. merry\\'s sword bursts into flame and his arm is. shot with pain. eowyn struggles to her feet pulling off her helmet eowyn her long hair tumbling onto her shoulders. with her last strength, eowyn thrusts her sword into the witch-king\\'s face. eowyn\\'s sword shatters into many shards. the witch-king topples back dead, a black ooze leaking from his robes and armour. a shuddering cry, fading into a shrill wail passes with the wind. the mumakil react with terror as spectral warriors climb up their sides, routing the haradrim from their war-towers. orcs flee in their thousands the terrified mumakil trampling them in their panic to escape. the army of the dead swarming over the city, routing the orcs. eowyn crawls to where theoden lays, mortally wounded. theoden looks up at eowyn his breathing shallow his vision clouded. eowyn smiles down at him as she gently strokes his face. theoden touches her tear-stained face. theoden dies eowyn breaks down, sobbing all around is a vista of defeat. pelennor fields strangely silent all orcs have fled battle debris and bodies stretch as far as the eye can see. above minas tirith blinding sun rays break through the low clouds. gandalf, legolas, gimli and pippin watch as aragorn walks slowly across the field of battle towards the hideous ghouls. the army of the dead slowly dissolve into dust, and are immediately swept away by the four winds. aragorn turns to gandalf who bows his head in homage. pippin running through the ruin of the battle towards a small figure slumped on the ground. merry stares unseeing at pippin horror and shock erasing all other memories from merry\\'s mind tears fall down pippin\\'s face as he looks on his friend. pippin covers merry with a blanket. camera rises towards the dark orc tower of cirith ungol. a light glows from the topmost window. camera reaches the tower, dissolving through the wall into. a small cold room. frodo baggins is unconscious on the floor. his eyes suddenly flicker and he wakes up. angle on frodo as he realizes that he has been stripped down to his underwear. he clutches at his throat. the ring has gone. gorbag grabs for the mithril vest. gorbag draws his sword, but shagrat kicks him backwards with his foot. gorbag falls through a trap door leading to the floor below. gorbag lands in the guard room with a crash, creating sudden alarm amongst the orcs and uruk-hai stationed there. shagrat leans through the trap door. the dead uruk-hai topples backwards over the parapet. landing on top of uruk-hai and orcs in the courtyard below. within moments, a brutal civil war breaks out between the two companies stationed in cirith ungol. sam hurries towards the gate, fearful for frodo. sam is confronted with the sight of over 50 slaughtered orc and uruk-hai, strewn over the courtyard. sam pounds up the staircase he suddenly pauses. several uruk-hai are running down towards him. he grips sting and continues charging up - screaming at the top of his lungs. the four uruks they see a huge distorted shadow on the wall in front of them. they turn around and flee in terror back to the top of the stairs. sam appears - and before the uruk-hai can fully regain their wits - he slays three yelling frodo struggling against his bonds, as gorbag climbs back into the room with vengeance in his evil eyes. gorbag grabs frodo\\'s hair and pulls his head back, exposing his neck. he pulls out his sword, ready to cut frodo\\'s throat. suddenly. gorbag gasps as sting is rammed into his back by sam. gorbag falls dead. frodo humbled by sam\\'s unswerving loyalty. sam quickly cuts frodo free. sam pulls the ring from his pocket. frodo looks at sam amazed his eyes drop to the rn ig sam hesitates tension instantly builds between them. sam seems strangely reluctant on the soundtrack to hum of the ring builds sam drops the ring into frodo\\'s palm. frodo sags in relief he puts the ring back around his nc . ek frodo looks at sam, pain in his eyes. sam looks down at frodo his plain hobbit face full of compassion. sam\\'s resolve hardens, a new strength takes hold. frodo and sam are now dressed in foul-looking orc gear. frodo and sam turn east and walk over the summit of cirith ungol into mordor. frodo and sam they stop dead staring ahead mount doom 50 m,iles away - across the barren gorgoroth plateau - the mountain is erupting streams of ash and lava high into the air, lighting the low cloud blanket of mordor with a flickering orange wash. with immense trepidation, frodo and sam head down the steep path into the dark kingdom. two tiny figures in a bleak, foreboding landscape. before them lies the plain of gorgoroth their eyes are drawn to the ominous silhouette of mount doom. frodo\\'s eyes travel down towards the hundreds of fires which glow on the plains beneath them thousands upon thousands of orcs are encamped there . their eyes are drawn to a dark looming shape barad-dur a red light seems to sweep across the plain. sam cannot see what frodo sees. gently, he urges frodo on. gandalf stands in the tower hall seemingly alone he speaks quietly, doubt and fear edge his voice. he turns and crosses the hall to reveal the presence of gimli, legolas, eomer and aragorn. aragorn, his back to gandalf. gandalf - still troubled, still worried. gimli sits insolently on the seat of the steward. gandalf looks across at the dwarf his face ashen. aragorn turns around suddenly. gandalf looks up sharply at aragorn. at this, gimli chokes on his pipe eomer steps forward. gandalf speaks in a low tone to aragorn. aragorn wearing a breast plate emblazoned with the white tree. he rides at the head of a column of 500 foot soldiers from rohan and condor leading them from the ruins of osgiliath. gandalf, legolas, gimli, eomer, merry and pippin ride directly behind him. ahead of them the mountains of mordor. great armies of orc and uruk-hai stream across the plains from mordor. the volcanic wasteland of the gorgoroth foothills. frodo and sam, still disguised in the orc armour, slide down scree bank and land on the road below their attention is fixed on the plain below thousands of orcs can be seen marching away from mt. doom. frodo and sam moving across a hellish dry landscape of twisted volcanic rock and steaming fissures. 40 miles away, mount doom rises out of the plain its feet founded in ashen ruin, its huge cone rising to a great height, where its reeking head is swathed in cloud. aragorn\\'s force of 500 approaches the great black gates of mordor. he positions his troops about half a mile from the gates. frodo slumped against a rock he tries to drink from his water bottle but finds it empty. frodo gratefully takes a small sip from sam\\'s bottle hands it back. a moment of eye contact between frodo and sam as they acknowledge what lies ahead. sam offers frodo his hand and pulls him up. at the black gates, aragorn musters his men. frodo and sam staggering across the tortured landscape they are no longer wearing the orc armour. frodo is walking half-bowed, often stumbling as if his eyes not longer see the way before his feet. his right hand is pressed against his chest supporting a heavy weight. his left hand often rises, as if to ward off some invisible blow. sam watches him, concern etched across his face. frodo as a malevolent voice in his head calls to him \"baggins - baggins\". sam looking behind him in time to see. a ray of red light stabs through the gloom and begins to sweep over the barren landscape. sam throws himself to the ground frodo turns to the light, unable to stop himself. frodo crumpling to the ground as the red light hits him like a searchlight. all is quiet no sign of the enemy. gandalf watchful alert. he nods at aragorn. aragorn, gandalf, legolas, gimli, eomer, merry and pippin galloping towards the black gates. they pull up less than 50 yards from the towering gates. frodo is slumped on the ground, unable to move. aragorn moves his horse forward. from behind the huge gates, the terrifying chanting and the clanging of the armour of thousands. with the sound of tortured metal, the massive gates begin to open legolas, merry and eomer look on in trepidation. with the eye of sauron sweeping the plains around them, sam gets to his feet. the black gates of mordor swing open. sauron\\'s army of 300,000 orcs march out. aragorn, gandalf, legolas, gimli, eomer, merry and pippin gallop back towards their small army as the orc masses slowly march toward them. behind them, the eye of sauron is directed toward them. frodo\\'s eyes open with a start. sam crawls toward frodo. frodo and sam stagger to their feet and move off. the massive orc army marching towards aragorn\\'s men. aragorn\\'s men starting to waver as the orcs encircle them. some men are backing away losing their nerve. aragorn gallops in front of his army. aragorn he seems to fix each and everyone of his men with his eyes. aragorn holds anduril aloft. frodo and sam are climbing the face of mount doom. the landscape is violent red heat hisses out of fissures, the rock is jagged razor sharp ash blankets the land. red lightning forks across the sky with a deafening crack. frodo and sam\\'s feet dragging across the ash their parched lips sweating, dusty faces. frodo trips falls face-first into the dust sam drops beside him. of aragorn\\'s army, totally surrounded by 300,000 orcs poised for the order to attack. frodo slowly lifts his head and looks up. frodo\\'s looking .straight up the steep slopes of mount doom a huge mass of ash and slag and burned stone. frodo starts to crawl on his hands and knees. he hauls himself a few pitiful feet before slumping in the ash. gimli as he surveys the army of mordor. gimli looks up into the eyes of legolas, with whom he has shared so much. the gruff dwarf smiles quietly. legolas drops his hand on gimli\\'s shoulder slowly they turn and face the enemy together. sam crawls to frodo who lies slumped against the rock-face he turns him over, holding him in his arms. frodo shuts his eyes, his breath coming in gasps. with that, sam lifts frodo on to his shoulders and starts to climb mount doom. his plain hobbit-face grows stern, almost grim, as the will hardens in him. two tiny hobbits on the endless shale slopes of the mountain. aragorn and company watch as they are surrounded by a tide of orcs. aragorn raises anduril in the broad sweep as he walks forward he turns to face the others. quiet resolve written on aragorn\\'s face as he looks into the eyes of the remaining members of the fellowship. aragorn turning, sword-raised, he charges forward. there is a moment of silence no-one else moves suddenly a shout goes up. pippin and merry charging forward the rest of the men following. aragorn crashing head on into a line of orcs. the blade of anduril flashing as aragorn hacks at orcs. like a small grey insect, sam creeps up the slope with frodo on his back foot by foot. the mantling cloud swirls, revealing the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of barad-dur, the dark tower, in the distance. sam staggering under frodo\\'s weight strong ash- laden winds are buffeting him as he slowly climbs mount doom. the plain of gorgoroth lies 1000 feet below, wrapped in fume and shadow. a tremor ripples through the ground a red flame explodes into the sky. sam looks up - fearful the mountain could explode at any moment. through the thick, fume-laden air a set of stairs can be made out. sam can\\'t believe it - relief and joy flood through him. smack out of nowhere the figure of smeagol crashes into them sending sam and frodo sprawling. smeagol pounces on frodo his fingers wrapping around his throat, snapping frodo\\'s neck from side to side. frodo as he struggles to unlock the bony, white fingers around his neck but smeagol\\'s grip is too strong. smeagol\\'s fingers tightening around frodo\\'s neck - squeezing the life out of him. frodo comes to. the battle between men and orcs rages on from mordor, high overhead, the nazgul fly out into the fray. all the old hatred between sam and smeagol boils over as they fight sam falls back smeagol biting at his shoulder. sam pushes smeagol away with his feet rolls to his knees, as smeagol charges at him. sam slashes out with sting. he cuts smeagol across the stomach. smeagol staggers back, screaming with pain. sam looks around desperately for frodo. frodo has gone. frodo running up the mountain. fellowship fight bravely a hideous screech rends the air. gandalf looks up to a nazgul diving straight toward him. gandalf eyes flicker as a small moth flutters across his line of sight. another cry rends the air as. smack. the giant eagle, gwahir, smashes into the fellbeast, it\\'s claws ripping into the hideous monster\\'s neck. pippin in the midst of battle looks up. above the battle attack formation, more eagles appear. pippin (cont\\'d) the eagles are coming. the eagles are coming. the eagles engage the nazgul. sam is gasping, his lungs exploding as he races up the slopes of mount doom searching for frodo. sam arriving at the stone doorway of sammath naur leading into the mountain. sam staggers into it. sam flinches against the fierce heat blasting down the tunnel. sam lurches forward towards an orange glow deep in the heart of the mountain. the heat is almost unbearable sam sees frodo in the distance. frodo is standing on the edge of the crack of doom a deep lava filled chasm, in the very heart of ancient sauron\\'s forges, the greatest in middle-earth. the raging orange glare from the chasm turns frodo into a black silhouette standing tense and still. frodo holds the ring in his hand he raises it, holding it over the bubbling lava far below.- frodo a strange expression on his face. the hum of the ring grows louder and louder. frodo pulls the ring close to his body as he turns to sam. frodo looks at sam, the ring has finally taken him. sam screams as. frodo puts the ring on. he vanishes. with a storm of wings, the nazgul wheel around and hurtle towards mount doom. in the midst of the battle - gandalf realising frodo has been seen. sam is screaming for frodo. footprints moving across the ash covered cavern floor. suddenly. gollum smashes a rock down on sam\\'s head, knocking him to the ground. gollum leaps on to the invisible frodo. frodo\\'s footprints staggering about under gollum\\'s weight. gollum clawing frantically, riding on the back of the invisible frodo. aragorn turns and is confronted by an armoured troll, wielding an enormous mallet. gollum suddenly lifts his hands to his face and bites hard. frodo materializes as he drops to his knees, clutching his bleeding hand he screams. legolas as aragorn falls to the ground. gollum triumphantly holds the ring aloft ecstatic. gollum dancing gleefully perilously close to the edge of the chasm. aragorn turns to see huge troll feet moving closer legolas races toward him. gollum still triumphant on the edge of the precipice the fiery lava casting an evil light he jumps about in delight. frodo rises slowly his eyes lock on gollum time seems to stand still as each regards the other. the ring glinting in gollum\\'s hand beautiful powerful evil. suddenly. frodo lunges at gollum. frodo thuds into gollum, lifting him off his feet. thud. the huge foot of the cave troll lands on aragorn\\'s chest. he stabs at. it ineffectually. gandalf in despair. sam watches in horror as frodo and gollum disappear into the chasm. he staggers over. gollum falls into the crack of doom instantly engulfed in the churning lava. sam leans into the crack of doom. frodo clinging onto the rock face with his one good hand. the caverns are shaking violently. sam desperately reaches for him frodo is too far down. frodo looks at sam, his face impassive. frodo struggles to reach sam he.can\\'t reach with his bleeding hand, and falls\\'back, still clinging valiantly to the rock with his good hand. frodo looks at sam imploringly. frodo reaches up once more and this time sam grasps his hand tightly . the ring sits on the river of lava for a brief moment, then sinks away. the eye of sauron. across the great plains - mount doom is clearly imploding. on the battlefield, all eyes turn to mount doom. the cave troll, with aragorn at his mercy, is distracted by the sounds emanating from mordor he turns in terror and runs off. the fellowship turn to watch as the massive dark tower of sauron shakes itself to pieces. towers fall and walls crumble vast spires of smoke and spouting steam billow up. the foundations explode apart. the black gates collapse in a huge cloud of ash. the company watch as mount doom explodes the reason for their misery is clear it\\'s plain frodo and sam can never survive the cataclysm. the volcano is erupting, fire belches from it\\'s riven summit, sending lava streaming down it\\'s sides. frodo and sam stagger out of the sammath naur door all around ash and molten rocks fall. the skies burst into thunder, seared with lightning. the screaming nazgul fall from the sky in flames. the ground is shaking so violently that frodo and sam can barely stand. frodo stumbles sam helps him up frodo smiles. sam looks down at frodo frodo\\'s face is at peace his burden destroyed. frodo and sam crawl onto a rock as lava streams towards them in seconds their rock is an island in a sea of molten fire. ,\\' . frodo shuts his eyes. frodo glances at sam he is weeping. frodo wrapping an arm around sam\\'s shoulder. two tiny hobbits waiting to die amid a cataclysmic landscape lava erupts around them fireballs rain down from the sky. gwaihir, the great eagle flaps towards camera he bears gandalf on his back, and is followed by two more eagles. wide shot the eagles bravely fly amid the raining ash and molten rocks and snatch frodo and sam from the rock. frodo\\'s face as the fiery volcano recedes away beneath him the wind ruffles his hair he passes out. frodo\\'s eyes flutter open looking around slowly his eyes alight on gandalf. as merry and pippin run in jumping on the bed and hugging frodo. gimli and legolas enter the room their joy is plain. aragorn joins them - the fellowship is complete. finally frodo\\'s eyes fall upon a figure standing apart from the others it is sam. frodo\\'s and sam\\'s eyes meet. sweeping over the minas tirith walls, racing towards the top of the city through a blizzard of white flower petals. minas tirith is restored it gleams white in the bright sun. to reveal the court of the kings, crowded with 4000 people cramming the wide path leading to the tower hall. the crown of condor glints in the brilliant sunshine. gandalf places the crown upon aragorn\\'s head. aragorn smiles up at gandalf. aragorn slowly rises, turning to face the crowd, who cheer and clap for their king. the cheers of his people are deafening. aragorn sings for his people then walks in slow procession down the white paved path as the crowd bow their heads in respect to their new king. aragorn passes eowyn and faramir who bow before him eomer steps forward to bow in respect. trumpets sound as a procession of elves, dressed in shimmering silvers and whites, led by legolas approach the king legolas gestures behind him. aragorn\\'s eyes scan amongst the elves a banner carried aloft bearing the white tree of condor in full flower the ranks of elves part revealing arwen, eyes shining mortal now, but deeply in love carrying the standard of condor aragorn kisses her elrond looks on his face breaks into a smile. aragorn and arwen embrace. aragorn and arwen walking through the crowd towards four small figures who stand nervously at the end of the avenue. aragorn and arwen look on frodo, sam, merry and pippin, as they stand before them. the four hobbits, dressed in their old clothes, clean and mended, bow their heads. aragorn raises his hand. tears spring into frodo\\'s eyes. he clutches sam\\'s shoulder as 4000 people pay homage to the courage of two little hobbits from the shire. camera rises into the air away from the crowded citadel, until minas tirith becomes a speck in the landscape. dissolving into the parchment map of middle-earth slowly drifting across the map towards the west. revealing hobbiton bathed in a warm sunset as frodo, sam, merry and pippin ride into shot on ponies past odo proudfoot who shakes his head at the strangeness of their appearance. frodo brings a round of drinks to the table. the four friends look at each other. a world of experience now separates from their fellow hobbits. seated at a long table, the four friends raise their glasses sam eye is suddenly caught. rosie cotton who is serving behind the bar. sam steels himself and leaves to go and talk to rosie. frodo, merry and pippin exchange smiles as. on a beautiful sunny day, sam and rosie are married with their dearest friends gathered around them. rosie throws a beautiful bouquet of flowers it\\'s caught by pippin who smiles in embarrassment. frodo walks through bag end to his study. frodo from behind. he is hunched over a desk. frodo winces with a sharp gasp of pain he puts the pen down and clutches at his shoulder. sam has entered the room and stands behind frodo. frodo he is drawn and pale. sam at a loss for words. his eyes fall to the book \\' to frodo\\'s handwriting lyrical music over. a cold winter\\'s morning out of the fog rattles a small covered wagon gandalf is at the reins. frodo, sam, merry and pippin are waiting on ponies for the wagon all are wearing their grey elven robes. gandalf arrives in his cart. the wagon trundles along at a sedate pace. sam, merry and pippin ride behind, leading frodo\\'s empty pony. frodo is sitting in the wagon his arm around his uncle bilbo. bilbo is extremely old and frail. he is dozing his head slumped. bilbo nods back to sleep frodo rests his head against him. frodo, walking arm-in-arm with bilbo through a beautiful elven boat-house gandalf follows with merry, pippin and sam. as bilbo looks up, he is stung by the beauty before hm i passing under a beautiful elven archway. to reveal a white ship, ready to depart from a white stone dock. elrond, celeborn and galadriel are waiting for them. bilbo bows in acknowledgement to elrond, celeborn and galadriel, who return his greeting. bilbo walks down toward the boat and boards with elrond. frodo looks up galadriel is watching him. she smiles, turns and boards the boat. gandalf kneels before sam, merry and pippin - who are all looking tearful. there is great sadness merry sniffles loudly. gandalf looks at frodo then turns and slowly walks towards the gangplank to board the ship. frodo turns to sam. sam looks down frodo is holding bilbo\\'s red journal out towards him. sam is sobbing merry and pippin are distraught. frodo hugs merry and pippin, and last of all sam and climbs on board the ship. frodo a look of wonderment crosses his face as he steps forward and accepts gandalf\\'s hand finally released from his pain, care falls from his face he is the young frodo we first met so long ago. sam, merry and pippin comfort each other as the white ship glides away from the dock. sam walks up the path towards his house. a little girl toddles up to greet him. he hugs his daughter. rosie cotton steps up and kisses sam on the cheek she gives him a tiny baby boy to cradle. sam with his family he draws a deep breath sam looks at his lovely family with great happiness, tinged with a little sadness. sam and rosie take the children\\'s hands and enter bagshot the bright yellow doorway closes behind them.
