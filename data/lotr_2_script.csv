0	 THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS	 Screenplay by  Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens. Based on "The Lord of The Rings" trilogy by J.R.R Tolkien.
1	 [TITLE:  THE LORD OF THE RINGS]	 [Camera pans over the Misty Mountains  as voices drift in from the background.]
2	 GANDALF	 You cannot pass!
3	 FRODO	 Gandalf!
4	 GANDALF	 I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder  of the Flame of Anor!
5	 GANDALF	 Argh! Go back to the shadow. The Dark  Fire will not avail you, Flame of Ud%n!  [Camera zooms in through the mountain  and focuses on Gandalf and the Balrog  on the bridge of Khazad-d%m. The Balrog  strikes down on Gandalf with its flaming  sword. Gandalf parries the blow with  Glamdring, shattering the Balrog%s sword.]
6	 YOU% SHALL NOT... PASS!!!	 
7	 GANDALF	 Argh! [Frodo rushes forward but Boromir restrains  him.]
8	 BOROMIR	 No! No!
9	 FRODO	 Gandalf!
10	 GANDALF	 Fly, you fools! [Gandalf loses his grip and falls into  the chasm]
11	 FRODO	 Noooooooooooooooo!!!! [Gandalf loses his grip and falls into  the chasm]
12	 FRODO	 [Calls after Gandalf as he falls into  the abyss] Gaaandaaaaalf!!
13	 FRODO	 Gandalf!
14	 SAM	 What is it, Mr. Frodo?
15	 FRODO	 Nothing. Just a dream. [Lies back down.]
16	 SAM	 Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth  we don%t want to see any closer, and  the one place we%re trying to get to.  It%s just where we can%t get. Let%s  face it, Mr. Frodo, we%re lost. I don%t  think Gandalf meant for us to come this  way.
17	 FRODO	 He didn%t mean for a lot of things to  happen, Sam... but they did.
18	 SAM	 Mr. Frodo? It%s the Ring, isn%t it?
19	 FRODO	 It%s getting heavier. [Clutches the  Ring by his chest and sits down, still  panting. He then fumbles for his water  bottle and takes a sip.]
20	 FRODO	 What food have we got left?
21	 SAM	 Well, let me see. [He takes out a package  of lembas bread from his pack] Oh yes,  lovely % Lembas bread. And look! [He  digs deeper into his pack] More lembas  bread.
22	 SAM	 I don't usually hold with foreign food,  but this Elvish stuff, it%s not bad.
23	 FRODO	 [smiles] Nothing ever dampens your spirits,  does it Sam?
24	 SAM	 Those rain clouds might. [They continue trekking through difficult  terrain, often huddling underneath their  cloaks.]
25	 SAM	 [Looks around] This looks strangely  familiar.
26	 FRODO	 [Exasperated] It%s because we%ve been  here before! We%re going in circles.
27	 SAM	 Ah! What's that 'orrid stink? I'll warrant  there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you  smell it?
28	 FRODO	 Yes. I can smell it. [Drops to a whisper]  We%re not alone.
29	 [NIGHTTIME	 Frodo and Sam are sleeping. A dark shape  appears on top of the cliff. The creature  Gollum has appeared and is making his  way down to the hobbits.]
30	 GOLLUM	 The thieves! The thieves! The filthy  little thieves! Where is it? Where isss  it? They stole it from us. My preciousss.  [Gollum creeps closer and closer.] Curse  them! We hates them! It%s ours, it is...  and we wantssss it!
31	 FRODO	 [menacingly] This is Sting. You%ve seen  it before, haven%t you... Gollum! Release  him or I%ll cut your throat!
32	 GOLLUM	 It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty  Elves twisted it. Take it off us!
33	 SAM	 Quiet you! [Sam tugs fiercely at the rope. Gollum  cries some more and collapses onto his  back. Sam turns to Frodo in dismay.]
34	 SAM	 It%s hopeless! Every Orc in Mordor%s  going to hear this racket! Let%s just  tie him up and leave him.
35	 GOLLUM	 No! That would kill us! Kill us!
36	 SAM	 It%s no more than you deserve!
37	 FRODO	 Maybe he does deserve to die, but now  that I see him, I do pity him.
38	 GOLLUM	 [Begging] We be nice to them if they  be nice to us. Take it off us. We swears  to do what you wants. We swears.
39	 FRODO	 There%s no promise you can make that  I can trust.
40	 GOLLUM	 We swears to serve the master of the  preciousss. We swears on... on the precious.  *Gollum. Gollum.*
41	 FRODO	 The Ring is treacherous. It will hold  you to your word.
42	 GOLLUM	 Yes... on the preciousss. On the preciousss.
43	 SAM	 I don%t believe you! [Gollum backs away,  frightened, and climbs onto a boulder]  Get down! I said, down!
44	 FRODO	 Sam!
45	 SAM	 He%s trying to trick us! We let him  go he%ll throttle us in our sleep!
46	 FRODO	 You know the way to Mordor?
47	 GOLLUM	 [nods warily] Yes...
48	 FRODO	 You%ve been there before?
49	 GOLLUM	 [nods again] Yes... [Frodo reaches out and takes the rope  noose off Gollum%s neck. Gollum seems  surprised and relieved.]
50	 FRODO	 You will lead us to the Black Gate.
51	 PIPPIN	 Merry. Merry! [He receives no response.]
52	 UGL%K	 What is it? What do you smell?
53	 MAN-FLESH URUK	 [sniffs the air] Man-flesh.
54	 PIPPIN	 [quietly to himself] Aragorn!
55	 UGL%K	 They've picked up our trail! Let's move!
56	 ARAGORN	 Their pace has quickened. [He looks  up.] They must have caught our scent.  Hurry! [He runs off.]
57	 LEGOLAS	 Come on, Gimli! [Looks back at Gimli  and then runs after Aragorn]
58	 GIMLI	 [pauses in his steps and huffs] Three  days% and nights% pursuit. No food.  No rest. And no sign of our quarry but  what bare rock can tell. [Runs after  his companions.]
59	 ARAGORN	 Not idly do the leaves of L%rien fall.
60	 LEGOLAS	 [stops and turns to Aragorn.] They may  yet be alive.
61	 ARAGORN	 Less than a day ahead of us. Come! [Runs  off again]
62	 LEGOLAS	 Come, Gimli! We are gaining on them!
63	 GIMLI	 [Panting] I am wasted on cross-country!  We dwarves are natural sprinters! Very  dangerous over short distances!
64	 ARAGORN	 Rohan. Home of the horse-lords. There  is something strange at work here. Some  evil gives speed to these creatures,  sets its will against us.
65	 ARAGORN	 Legolas, what do your Elf eyes see?
66	 LEGOLAS	 The Uruks turn northeast. They%re taking  the hobbits to Isengard!
67	 ARAGORN	 Saruman. [The tower of Orthanc stands amidst  the smoking caverns of Isengard. Saruman  stands in his chamber, communicating  with the Dark Lord through the Palant%r.]
68	 SARUMAN (V.O.)	 The world is changing. [View changes  to the tower of Barad-d%r, with its  huge Orc armies on a bridge.] Who now  has the strength to stand against the  armies of Isengard and Mordor? To stand  against the might of Sauron and Saruman  and the union of the two towers?
69	 SARUMAN (V.O.)	 Together, my lord Sauron, we shall rule  this Middle-earth.
70	 SARUMAN (V.O.)	 The old world will burn in the fires  of industry. The forests will fall.  A new order will rise. We will drive  the machine of war with the sword and  the spear and the iron fists of the  Orc. We have only to remove those who  oppose us.
71	 SARUMAN	 The horsemen took your land. They drove  your people into the hills to scratch  a living off rocks.
72	 DUNLAND MAN	 Murderers!
73	 SARUMAN	 Take back the lands they stole from  you! Burn every village!
74	 CROWD	 [Roars with approval] Argh!! [They stomp off to destroy the villages  of Rohan as Saruman stands coldly still  among the stampede. A Rohan village  is in pandemonium as people try to escape  the on-coming pillage.]
75	 SARUMAN (V.O.)	 It will begin in Rohan. Too long have  these peasants stood against you. But  no more.
76	 MORWEN	 %othain! %othain! You take your sister.  You%ll go faster with just two.
77	 FREDA	 [As Morwen puts her onto the horse in  front of her brother] Papa says %othain  must not ride Garulf, he is too big  for him!
78	 MORWEN	 Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras  and raise the alarm. Do you understand  me?
79	 %OTHAIN	 Yes, Ma!
80	 FREDA	 [starts to cry] I don%t wanna leave!  I don't wanna go, Mama!
81	 MORWEN	 Freda, I will find you there. [A woman screams]
82	 MORWEN	 Quickly! [The children ride off.]
83	 MORWEN	 [Looks after them] Go child! [Dunlanders and Uruk-hai enter the village,  burning everything in sights as the  Rohirrim scream and run in all directions.  %othain and Freda weep as they look  back from a distance.]
84	 SARUMAN (V.O.)	 Rohan, my lord, is ready to fall. [A group of horsemen ride to Edoras.  %omer is in the lead, carrying a gravely  wounded Th%odred.]
85	 %OWYN	 Th%odred! [Th%odred seems to hear her call but  is unable to respond. He has a bloody  gash on the side of his head. %omer  nods to %owyn in the direction of Th%odred%s  torso. %owyn draws back the covers and  upon seeing Th%odred%s fatal wound,  her lips tighten and eyes close. She  looks up to catch %omer%s eye.]
86	 %OWYN	 Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
87	 %OMER	 He was ambushed by Orcs. If we don%t  defend our country, Saruman will take  it by force.
88	 GR%MA	 That is a lie! [Appears from the shadows.]  Saruman the White has ever been our  friend and ally.
89	 TH%ODEN	 [mumbles feebly] Gr%ma% Gr%ma% [Gr%ma  leans down close to the King.]My son...?  Gr%ma...?
90	 %OMER	 Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.  Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at  will. Orcs bearing the white hand of  Saruman. [He drops a helmet onto the  ground, which topples over to reveal  the white hand of Saruman.]
91	 GR%MA	 Why do you lay these troubles on an  already troubled mind. Can you not see?  Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent,  your war-mongering.
92	 %OMER	 War-mongering? [%omer grabs Gr%ma and pins him against  a pillar.]
93	 %OMER	 How long is it since Saruman bought  you? What was the promised price, Gr%ma?  When all the men are dead you will take  your share of the treasure?
94	 %OMER	 Too long have you watched my sister,  too long have you haunted her steps.
95	 GR%MA	 You see much %omer, Son of %omund. Too  much. [The thugs punch %omer n the stomach]  You are banished forthwith from the  kingdom of Rohan. Under pain of death!
96	 %OMER	 [Being dragged away] Argh!! [Uruk-hai and Orcs continue to march  across the plains with their hobbit  captives, with Aragorn, Legolas, and  Gimli hot on their pursuits.]
97	 GIMLI	 Keep breathing! That%s the key! Breathe!  Ho!
98	 LEGOLAS	 They%ve run as if the very whips of  their masters were behind them.
99	 MORDOR ORC	 We%re not going no further till we%ve  had a breather!
100	 UGL%K	 Get a fire going! [As the Orcs and Uruk-hai take their  rest, Pippin crawls over towards Merry.]
101	 PIPPIN	 Merry! Merry!
102	 MERRY	 [opens his eyes] I think... we might  have made a mistake leaving the Shire,  Pippin.
103	 PIPPIN	 What%s making that noise?
104	 MERRY	 [looks towards the forest] It%s the  trees.
105	 PIPPIN	 What?
106	 MERRY	 Do you remember the Old Forest? On the  borders of Buckland? Folk used to say  that there was something in the water  that made the trees grow tall... and  come alive.
107	 PIPPIN	 Alive?
108	 MERRY	 Trees that could whisper. Talk to each  other. Even move.
109	 MA%HUR	 I'm starving. We ain't 'ad nothin' but  maggoty bread for three stinkin' days!
110	 SNAGA	 Yeah. Why can%t we have some meat? [His  eyes rest on the hobbits.] What about  them? They%re fresh.
111	 UGL%K	 They are not for eating!
112	 GRISHN%KH	 What about their legs? They don't need  those. Ooh% They look tasty!
113	 UGL%K	 [Shoves at the Orcs] Get back, scum!
114	 MORDOR ORC	 Carve them up!
115	 SNAGA	 [Moves towards the hobbits with his  blade drawn] Just a mouth full.
116	 UGL%K	 No! [Pippin and Merry recoil in fright.  Ugl%k jumps on the Orc and cuts off  his head, which bounces off the hobbit's  shoulders.]
117	 UGL%K	 Looks like meat%s back on the menu,  boys!!
118	 MERRY	 Pippin, let%s go. [Their hands still bound, the hobbits  try to crawl away. Suddenly a foot comes  down on Merry and Pippin is turned onto  his back.]
119	 GRISHN%KH	 [Brandishing a blade in front of Pippin%s  face] Go on, call for help. Squeal!  No one%s gonna save you now!
120	 MERRY	 Pippin! [Gestures for them to make their  escape.]
121	 PIPPIN	 ARGH!!!
122	 ARGH!!!	 [The Three Hunters are still chasing  after the Uruk-hai. It is dawn.]
123	 LEGOLAS	 [Pauses and looks up] A red sun rises.  Blood has been spilled this night.
124	 ARAGORN	 Riders of Rohan, what news from the  Mark?
125	 %OMER	 What business does an Elf, a man and  a Dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speak  quickly!
126	 GIMLI	 Give me your name, Horsemaster, and  I shall give you mine.
127	 %OMER	 I would cut off your head, Dwarf, if  it stood but a little higher from the  ground.
128	 LEGOLAS	 You would die before your stroke fell!
129	 ARAGORN	 I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This  is Gimli, son of Gl%in and Legolas of  the Woodland realm. We are friends of  Rohan and of Th%oden, your king.
130	 %OMER	 Th%oden no longer recognizes friend  from foe. [Takes off helmet] Not even  his own kin.
131	 %OMER	 Saruman has poisoned the mind of the  king and claimed lordship over these  lands. My company are those loyal to  Rohan. And for that, we are banished.  The White Wizard is cunning. He walks  here and there, they say, as an old  man, hooded and cloaked. And everywhere  his spies slip past our nets.
132	 ARAGORN	 We are not spies. We track a party of  Uruk-hai westward across the plain.  They%ve taken two of our friends captive.
133	 %OMER	 The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered  them during the night.
134	 GIMLI	 But there were two hobbits. Did you  see two hobbits with them?
135	 ARAGORN	 They would be small % only children  to your eyes.
136	 %OMER	 We left none alive. We piled the carcasses  and burned them. [Points to a smoking  pile in the distance.]
137	 GIMLI	 Dead?
138	 %OMER	 [nods] I am sorry. [Legolas puts a hand on Gimli%s shoulder  in grief. %omer turns and whistles.]
139	 %OMER	 Hasufel! Arod! [Two horses move up.]  May these horses bear you to better  fortune than their former masters. Farewell.
140	 %OMER	 Look for your friends. But do not trust  to hope, it has forsaken these lands.  [To the riders] We ride north!
141	 GIMLI	 It%s one of their wee belts.
142	 LEGOLAS	 [with his head bowed and eyes closed]  Hiro %th% ab 'wanath... (May they find  peace in death)
143	 ARAGORN	 [Kicks a helmet and yells] AAARRGGHH!!!  [He falls to his knees.]
144	 GIMLI	 We failed them. [Aragorn looks to the side as some tracks  catch his attention.]
145	 ARAGORN	 A hobbit lay here, and the other. [Flashback:  Pippin yells as he looks up at a pair  of thrashing hooves bearing down on  him. He rolls over, avoiding the hooves.]  They crawled.
146	 [ARAGORN STARTS TO FOLLOW THE TRACKS, WITH LEGOLAS AND GIMLI BEHIND HIM. FLASHBACK	 Merry and Pippin crawl frantically away  from the battle.]
147	 ARAGORN	 Their hands were bound. [Flashback:  Merry rubs his bonds furiously against  the sharp edge of a weapon.] Their bonds  were cut. [Aragorn holds up a broken  length of thick rope.]
148	 ARAGORN	 They ran over here. They were followed.
149	 [FLASHBACK	 Their hands freed, the hobbits run away  from the battle scene, dodging under  a horse and trying to stay out of harms  way. As they flee, Grishn%kh grabs Pippin  by his belt and clings on.]
150	 MERRY	 The belt! [Pippin undoes his belt and Grishn%kh  is left holding it.]
151	 MERRY	 Run!
152	 ARAGORN	 The tracks lead away from the battle...  [They break into a run and then stop]  into Fangorn Forest.
153	 GIMLI	 Fangorn. What madness drove them in  there?
154	 PIPPIN	 Did we lose him? [Looks around] I think  we lost him.
155	 GRISHN%KH	 I%m gonna rip out your filthy little  innards! Come here!
156	 MERRY	 Trees! Climb a tree! [Pippin and Merry quickly scramble up  a tree each.]
157	 MERRY	 [Looks around and then sighs in relief.]  He's gone.
158	 PIPPIN	 Merry! [Pippin looks down in horror but as  he turns his head, he spots a pair of  gleaming yellow eyes blinking in the  tree he%s clinging to. The tree starts  to move and groan.]
159	 TREEBEARD	 Hooooo...
160	 PIPPIN	 Argh!! [Pippin loses his grip in fright and  grabs at the air futilely as he falls.  The tree catches him before he hits  the ground.]
161	 GRISHN%KH	 Let%s put a maggot-hole in your belly.  [Suddenly he senses something behind  him and as he looks up, the tree stomps  and squashes him onto the forest floor.]
162	 PIPPIN	 Run, Merry! [Merry tries to run away but is scooped  by the tree.]
163	 TREEBEARD	 [Looks at the creatures in his hands]  Little Orcs! Bur%rum...
164	 PIPPIN	 It%s talking, Merry. The tree is talking!
165	 TREEBEARD	 Tree?! I am no tree. I am an Ent. [Stomps  slowly through the forest.]
166	 MERRY	 A treeherder! A shepherd of the forest.
167	 PIPPIN	 Don%t talk to it, Merry. Don%t encourage  it.
168	 TREEBEARD	 Treebeard, some call me.
169	 PIPPIN	 And whose side are you on?
170	 TREEBEARD	 Side? I am on nobody%s side because  nobody%s on my side, little Orc. Nobody  cares for the woods anymore.
171	 MERRY	 We%re not Orcs. We%re Hobbits!
172	 TREEBEARD	 Hobbits? Never heard of a hobbit before.  Sounds like Orc mischief to me! [Tightens  his hold on the hobbits and squeezes  them. Merry and Pippin whimpers in pain]  They come with fire, they come with  axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking,  burning! Destroyers and usurpers, curse  them!
173	 MERRY	 No, you don%t understand. We%re Hobbits...  Halflings! Shirefolk!
174	 TREEBEARD	 Maybe you are and maybe you aren%t.  The White Wizard will know.
175	 PIPPIN	 The White Wizard?
176	 MERRY	 Saruman. [Treebeard drops them on the ground  and the hobbits look up at the White  Wizard.]
177	 GOLLUM	 See, see, we have led you out! Hurry  hobbitses hurry. Very lucky we find  you.
178	 GOLLUM	 Nice hobbit. [Leaps after Frodo, putting  a wide berth between him and Sam.]
179	 SAM	 Whoa, it%s a bog! He%s led us into a  swamp!
180	 GOLLUM	 A swamp, yes, yes. Come, master. We  will take you on safe paths through  the mist. Come, hobbits, come. We go  quickly.
181	 GOLLUM	 I found it, I did. The way through the  marshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't  know it. They go round for miles and  miles. Come quickly. Swift and quick  as shadows we must be.
182	 SAM	 There are dead things! Dead faces in  the water!
183	 GOLLUM	 All dead. All rotten. Elves and men  and orcses. A great battle long ago.  [Turns to face the hobbits.] The Dead  Marshes. Yes, yes that is their name.  This way. Don%t follow the lights.
184	 SAM	 Ohh!
185	 GOLLUM	 Careful now, or hobbits go down to join  the dead ones and light little candles  of their own.
186	 SAM	 Frodo! [Frodo is in the water and sees many  faces of the dead, no longer still but  screaming and grasping, their rotten  robes and hair flowing about their gruesome  faces. Their hands are reaching for  him. Suddenly he is grabbed from behind.  Frodo sputters and gasps for air as  Gollum pulls him out of the water.]
187	 FRODO	 [Looks at Gollum in perplexed gratitude  and disbelief.] Gollum...
188	 GOLLUM	 Don%t follow the lights! [Crawls away]
189	 SAM	 [Runs to Frodo%s side.] Mr. Frodo! Are  you alright?
190	 [NIGHTFALL	 Sam is asleep but Frodo is still awake.  He is holding the Ring in the palm of  his hand and stroking it, mesmerized.  Suddenly he hears Gollum.]
191	 GOLLUM	 Sooo bright. Sooo beautiful. [Frodo  quickly puts the Ring back inside his  shirt. He looks up to see Gollum crouching  away from him, stroking the centre of  his palm] our preciousss...
192	 FRODO	 What did you say?
193	 GOLLUM	 Master should be resting. Master needs  to keep up his strength.
194	 FRODO	 [Moves over and crouches in front of  Gollum] Who are you?
195	 GOLLUM	 Mustn%t ask us. Not its business. *Gollum,  Gollum*
196	 FRODO	 Gandalf told me you were one of the  River Folk.
197	 GOLLUM	 Cold be heart and hand and bone. Cold  be travellers far from home.
198	 FRODO	 He said your life was a sad story.
199	 GOLLUM	 They do not see what lies ahead, when  sun has failed and moon is dead.
200	 FRODO	 You were not so very different from  a hobbit once, were you... Sm%agol?
201	 GOLLUM	 [Looks up slowly.] What did you call  me?
202	 FRODO	 That was your name once, wasn%t it?  A long time ago.
203	 GOLLUM	 My name... My name... S... S...Sm%agol%
204	 GOLLUM	 Argh!!
205	 SAM	 Black Riders!
206	 GOLLUM	 Hide! Hide!
207	 FRODO	 Argh! [Suddenly Frodo feels the pain of the  Nazg%l's sword piercing him and the  call of the Ring. Images of the Ringwraiths  come to him in flashes.]
208	 FRODO	 Argh!!
209	 SAM	 C%mon Frodo! C'mon! [Frodo continues to clutch at the Ring  on his chest, immobilized. Sam drags  Frodo across to hide beneath some bramble  bushes. The Nazg%l appears, tightening  his hold on the reins. Camera then shows  him riding a Fell Beast, swooping down  across the marsh lands. Chilling screams  of the Nazg%l fill the air.]
210	 GOLLUM	 Quick! They will see us! They will see  us!
211	 SAM	 I thought they were dead!
212	 GOLLUM	 Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No.
213	 GOLLUM	 [cowering] Wraiths! Wraiths on wings!  They are calling for it. They are calling  for the preciousss.
214	 SAM	 Mr. Frodo! It%s alright. I%m here.
215	 GOLLUM	 Hurry, hobbits. The Black Gate is very  close.
216	 GIMLI	 [Spits] Ptui! Orc blood.
217	 ARAGORN	 These are strange tracks.
218	 GIMLI	 The air is so close in here.
219	 LEGOLAS	 This forest is old. Very old. Full of  memory... and anger.
220	 LEGOLAS	 The trees are speaking to each other.
221	 ARAGORN	 [Whispers] Gimli!
222	 GIMLI	 Huh?
223	 ARAGORN	 [Gestures] Lower your axe.
224	 GIMLI	 [Lowering his axe slowly] Oh.
225	 LEGOLAS	 Aragorn, nad n% ennas! (Something is  out there.)
226	 ARAGORN	 Man cenich? (What do you see?) [Close-up of Legolas% eyes]
227	 LEGOLAS	 The White Wizard approaches.
228	 ARAGORN	 Do not let him speak. He will put a  spell on us.
229	 ARAGORN	 We must be quick. [With a yell, the three swing round  to attack. Gimli%s axe and Legolas%  arrow are deflected. Aragorn drops his  sword as it becomes red hot in his grasp.  They shield their eyes with their hands  from the bright light emanating from  the White Wizard.]
230	 WHITE WIZARD	 You are tracking the footsteps of two  young hobbits.
231	 ARAGORN	 Where are they?
232	 WHITE WIZARD	 They passed this way the day before  yesterday. They met someone they did  not expect. Does that comfort you?
233	 ARAGORN	 Who are you? Show yourself! [The bright light dims, revealing Gandalf,  all dressed in white. The three are  astounded. Legolas and Gimli bow.]
234	 ARAGORN	 It cannot be. You fell.
235	 GANDALF	 Through fire and water. [Flashback:  Gandalf is battling the Balrog atop  D%rin%s Tower.] From the lowest dungeon  to the highest peak, I fought with the  Balrog of Morgoth.
236	 GANDALF	 Until at last, I threw down my enemy  and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
237	 GANDALF	 Darkness took me. And I strayed out  of thought and time. [Camera zooms in  Gandalf%s eye and enters an amorphous  realm of stars and galaxies, ending  in a blinding white light] Stars wheeled  overhead and everyday was as long as  a life-age of the earth. But it was  not the end. I felt life in me again.
238	 GANDALF	 I've been sent back until my task is  done.
239	 ARAGORN	 Gandalf!
240	 GANDALF	 Gandalf? Yes... That's what they used  to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was  my name. [He smiles]
241	 GIMLI	 Gandalf!
242	 GANDALF	 [With a twinkle in his eye] I am Gandalf  the White. [Aragorn grins] And I come  back to you now at the turn of the tide.
243	 GANDALF	 One stage of your journey is over, another  begins. War has come to Rohan. We must  ride to Edoras with all speed.
244	 LEGOLAS	 That is one of the Mearas, unless my  eyes are cheated by some spell.
245	 GANDALF	 Shadowfax. [Gimli bows in the background.]  He's the lord of all horses and he's  been my friend through many dangers.
246	 TREEBEARD	 My home lies deep in the forest near  the roots of the mountain. I told Gandalf  I would keep you safe and safe is where  I%ll keep you. The trees have grown  wild and dangerous. Anger festers in  their hearts. They will harm you if  they can. There are too few of us now.  Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
247	 GOLLUM	 The Black Gate of Mordor. [The enormous Black Gate comes into  view with Orcs patrolling and standing  guard on the towers and atop the walls.  From the right, an army of Easterling  soldiers is marching to the Black Gate.]
248	 SAM	 Oh save us. My ol' Gaffer'd have a thing  or two to say if he could see us now.
249	 GOLLUM	 Master says to show him the way into  Mordor, so good Sm%agol does. Master  says so.
250	 FRODO	 I did. [Orcs are patrolling the Black Gate.]
251	 SAM	 That%s it then. We cannot get past that.
252	 SAM	 Look! The gate, it's opening! I can  see a way down.
253	 FRODO	 Sam, no!
254	 SAM	 Argh!! [Frodo goes after Sam.]
255	 GOLLUM	 Master! [Two Easterling soldiers see streams  of dust coming down the cliff made by  Sam and Frodo. They move away from the  troop to investigate. Frodo reaches  Sam who is stuck in the scree. As the  Easterlings move closer and closer,  Frodo throws his Elvish cloak over himself  and Sam. The soldiers are now directly  in front of Sam, but their eyes see  nothing but rock. Frodo and Sam peer  from underneath the cloak. The soldiers  soon leave and after a moment, Frodo  throws back the cloak and pulls Sam  out.]
256	 FRODO	 I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
257	 SAM	 I know, Mr Frodo. I doubt even these  Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
258	 FRODO	 Now! [Gollum pulls them back.]
259	 GOLLUM	 No! No, no master! They catch you! They  catch you! Don%t take it to him! He  wants the preciousss. Always he%s looking  for it! And the preciousss is wanting  to go back to him. But we mustn%t let  him have it.
260	 GOLLUM	 No! [Pulls Frodo back again.] There%s  another way. More secret. A dark way.
261	 SAM	 Why haven%t you spoken of this before?!
262	 GOLLUM	 Because Master did not ask!
263	 SAM	 He%s up to something.
264	 FRODO	 Are you saying there%s another way into  Mordor?
265	 GOLLUM	 Yes. There is a path, and some stairs,  and then% a tunnel. [Frodo and Sam watch as the Black Gate  closes. Gollum is stroking Frodo%s arm  and burying his face in his cloak.]
266	 FRODO	 He%s led us this far, Sam.
267	 SAM	 Mr. Frodo, no.
268	 FRODO	 He%s been true to his word.
269	 SAM	 [Whispers] No!
270	 FRODO	 Lead the way, Sm%agol.
271	 GOLLUM	 Good Sm%agol always helps. [Frodo follows Gollum as Sam stares  after him in disbelief.]
272	 GANDALF	 Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.  There dwells Th%oden, King of Rohan,  whose mind is overthrown. Saruman%s  hold over King Th%oden is now very strong.
273	 %OWYN	 My lord, your son, he is dead. My lord?  Uncle?
274	 %OWYN	 Will you not go to him? [She weeps.]  Will you do nothing?
275	 GANDALF	 Be careful what you say. Do not look  for welcome here.
276	 GR%MA	 Oh, he% he must have died sometime in  the night. What a tragedy for the king  to lose his only son and heir.
277	 GR%MA	 I understand his passing is hard to  accept, especially now that your brother  has deserted you.
278	 %OWYN	 [jumps back and throws off Gr%ma%s hand]  Leave me alone, snake!
279	 GR%MA	 [Rises from the bed and moves ever closer  to %owyn] Oh, but you are alone! Who  knows what you have spoken to the darkness.  In bitter watches of the night, when  all your life seems to shrink, the walls  of your bower closing in about you,  like a hutch to trammel some wild thing  in.
280	 GR%MA	 So fair, so cold, like a morning of  pale spring still clinging to winter's  chill.
281	 %OWYN	 Your words are poison! [%owyn runs out of the hall. Weeping,  she looks away into the distance. A  flag comes off its pole and is carried  by the breeze. %owyn sees riders coming  towards Edoras. As Aragorn passes the  entrance to Edoras, the flag floats  down to land near him. Edoras is silent  and somber. Everyone is dressed in black  and staring at the newcomers in wary  silence. Aragorn looks up at the hall  and sees a lady in white standing on  the steps. He looks around at more somber  people.]
282	 GIMLI	 You%ll find more cheer in a graveyard.
283	 GANDALF	 [sees H%ma] Ah.
284	 H%MA	 I cannot allow you before Th%oden-King  so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order  of Gr%ma Wormtongue.
285	 H%MA	 [gestures to Gandalf] Your staff.
286	 GANDALF	 Hmm? [Glances at his staff.] Oh. You  would not part an old man from his walking  stick? [Looks at H%ma innocently.]
287	 GR%MA	 [Leaning down and whispering to Th%oden.]  My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.  He%s a herald of woe.
288	 GANDALF	 The courtesy of your hall is somewhat  lessened of late, Th%oden King.
289	 GR%MA	 [Whispering to Th%oden.] He%s not welcome.
290	 TH%ODEN	 Why should I% welcome you, Gandalf%  Stormcrow? [Looks to Gr%ma for affirmation.]
291	 GR%MA	 A just question, my liege. [He walks  towards Gandalf.] Late is the hour in  which this conjurer chooses to appear.  Lathspell spell I name him. Ill news  is an ill guest.
292	 GANDALF	 Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind  you teeth. I have not passed through  fire and death to bandy crooked words  with a witless worm! [Raises his staff  against Gr%ma.]
293	 GR%MA	 His staff! [Backing away from Gandalf  while addressing the guards] I told  you to take the wizard%s staff!
294	 GANDALF	 Th%oden, son of Thengel, too long have  you sat in the shadows.
295	 GIMLI	 [Growls] I would stay still, if I were  you.
296	 GANDALF	 Hearken to me! I release you from the  spell. [Gestures with his hand]
297	 TH%ODEN	 [Menacingly] Hahahhhahahahah! [Gandalf  opens his eyes in surprise.] You have  no power here, Gandalf the Grey!
298	 TH%ODEN	 Argh!
299	 GANDALF	 [Points his staff towards Th%oden.]  I will draw you, Saruman, as poison  is drawn from a wound.
300	 ARAGORN	 Wait.
301	 TH%ODEN	 [In Saruman%s voice.] If I go. . . Th%oden  dies.
302	 GANDALF	 You did not kill me, you will not kill  him!
303	 TH%ODEN	 [in Saruman's voice] Rohan is mine!
304	 GANDALF	 Be gone!! [Gandalf smites Th%oden as he lunges  at him. Th%oden is thrown back into  the chair and the shot changes to Saruman  flying backwards from the Palant%r which  he used to manipulate Th%oden. He lands  landing hard on the floor of Orthanc,  bleeding from a gash in his forehead.  In the hall, Th%oden lets out a moan  and slumps forward in the chair. %owyn  runs to her uncle%s side as he falls.  Th%oden%s head rises again and his face  begins to change gradually into that  of a much younger-looking man. Clarity  and recognition returns to his eyes.]
305	 TH%ODEN	 [Looks closely at %owyn] I know your  face. %owyn% %owyn.
306	 TH%ODEN	 Gandalf?
307	 GANDALF	 Breathe the free air again, my friend.
308	 TH%ODEN	 [Standing up and looking around him.]  Dark have been my dreams of late. [He  looks down at his trembling hands.]
309	 GANDALF	 Your fingers would remember their old  strength better... if they grasped your  sword.
310	 GR%MA	 Argh! [Beseechingly to Th%oden] I've  only ever served you, my lord!
311	 TH%ODEN	 [Advancing towards Gr%ma, holding the  sword firmly in his hand] Your leechcraft  would have had me crawling on all fours  like a beast!
312	 GR%MA	 [Grovelling] Send me not from your side.
313	 ARAGORN	 No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go.  Enough blood has been spilled on his  account.
314	 GR%MA	 Get out of my way!
315	 H%MA	 Hail, Th%oden king! [The crowd kneels in homage before Th%oden.  Aragorn kneels also. Gr%ma rides out  of Edoras. As Th%oden turns to go back  into the hall, he looks up.]
316	 TH%ODEN	 Where is Th%odred? Where is my son?
317	 TH%ODEN	 Simbelmyn%. Ever has it grown on the  tombs of my forebearers. [Looks at Gandalf]  Now it shall cover the grave of my son.  Alas, that these evil days should be  mine. The young perish and the old linger.  That I should live to see the last days  of my house.
318	 GANDALF	 Th%odred%s death was not of your making.
319	 TH%ODEN	 No parent should have to bury their  child.
320	 GANDALF	 He was strong in life. His spirit will  find its way to the halls of your fathers.  Westu h%l. Fer%u, Th%odred, Fer%u. (Be-thou  well. Go-thou, Th%odred, go-thou.)
321	 %OWYN	 They had no warning. They were unarmed.  Now the wildmen are moving through the  Westfold, burning as they go. Rick,  cot and tree.
322	 FREDA	 Where%s mama?
323	 %OWYN	 Shh...
324	 GANDALF	 This is but a taste of the terror that  Saruman will unleash. All the more potent  for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.  Ride out and meet him head on. Draw  him away from your women and children.  [Leans forward and puts a hand on Th%oden%s  chair. Th%oden looks at his hand warily.]  You must fight.
325	 ARAGORN	 You have two thousand good men riding  north as we speak. %omer is loyal to  you. His men will return and fight for  their king.
326	 TH%ODEN	 They will be three hundred leagues from  here by now. %omer cannot help us. I  know what it is that you want of me.  But I will not bring further death to  my people. I will not risk open war.
327	 ARAGORN	 Open war is upon you. Whether you would  risk it or not.
328	 TH%ODEN	 When last I looked, Th%oden, not Aragorn,  was king of Rohan.
329	 GANDALF	 Then what is the king%s decision? [Scene shifts to outside Meduseld]
330	 H%MA	 By order of the king, the city must  empty. We make for the refuge of Helm%s  Deep. Do not burden yourselves with  treasures. Take only what provisions  you need.
331	 GIMLI	 Helm%s Deep! They flee to the mountains  when they should stand and fight. Who  will defend them if not their king.
332	 ARAGORN	 He%s only doing what he thinks is best  for his people. Helm%s Deep has saved  them in the past.
333	 GANDALF	 There is no way out of that ravine.  Th%oden is walking into a trap. He thinks  he%s leading them to safety. What they  will get is a massacre. Th%oden has  a strong will but I fear for him. I  fear for the survival of Rohan. He will  need you before the end, Aragorn. The  people of Rohan will need you. The defences  HAVE to hold.
334	 ARAGORN	 They will hold.
335	 GANDALF	 [Turns to Shadowfax and strokes him]  The Grey Pilgrim... that%s what they  used to call me. Three hundred lives  of men I%ve walked this earth and now  I have no time. With luck, my search  will not be in vain. Look to my coming  at first light on the fifth day. At  dawn, look to the East.
336	 ARAGORN	 [Opens the stall gates] Go. [Legolas jumps back as Gandalf rides  out of the stable and over the plains  of Rohan.]
337	 ARAGORN	 You have some skill with a blade. [With a swift move, %owyn swings her  sword and renders Aragorn vulnerable,  gaining the upper hand.]
338	 %OWYN	 [Stepping back and sheathing her sword.]  Women of this country learned long ago:  Those without swords may still die upon  them. I fear neither death nor pain.
339	 ARAGORN	 What do you fear, my lady?
340	 %OWYN	 A cage. To stay behind bars until use  and old age accept them and all chance  of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
341	 ARAGORN	 You are a daughter of kings, a shieldmaiden  of Rohan. [He sheaths his knife.] I  do not think that would be your fate.
342	 GR%MA	 Th%oden will not stay at Edoras. It%s  vulnerable, he knows this. He will expect  an attack on the city. They will flee  to Helm%s Deep, the great fortress of  Rohan. It is a dangerous road to take  through the mountains. They will be  slow. They will have women and children  with them.
343	 SARUMAN	 Send out your warg riders. [The Orc smiles. In a pit behind him,  ferocious growls are heard and shadows  dances.]
344	 SAM	 Hey Stinker! Don%t go getting too far  ahead!
345	 FRODO	 Why do you do that?
346	 SAM	 What?
347	 FRODO	 Call him names; run him down all the  time.
348	 SAM	 Because% because that's what he is,  Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in 'im  but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he  wants. It's all he cares about.
349	 FRODO	 [Glaring at Sam] You have no idea what  it did to him. What it%s still doing  to him. [He walks past Sam and stops.]  I want to help him, Sam...
350	 SAM	 Why?
351	 FRODO	 Because I have to believe he can come  back.
352	 SAM	 You can%t save him, Mr. Frodo.
353	 FRODO	 [Snapping at Sam]What do you know about  it? Nothing!
354	 FRODO	 [With remorse] I'm sorry, Sam. I don't  know why I said that.
355	 SAM	 [Looks back at Frodo with tears in his  eyes.] I do. It's the Ring. You can't  take your eyes off it. I've seen you.  You're not eating. You barely sleep.  It's taken a hold of you, Mr Frodo.  You have to fight it!
356	 FRODO	 [Grows angry again] I know what I have  to do Sam. The Ring was entrusted to  me! It's my task! Mine! My own! [He  walks away]
357	 SAM	 Can%t you hear yourself? Don%t you know  who you sound like?
358	 GOLLUM	 We wants it. We needs it. Must have  the precioussss. They stole it from  us. Sneaky little hobbitsesss. Wicked,  trickssssy, falssse!
359	 SM%AGOL	 No! Not Master.
360	 GOLLUM	 Yes, precious. False. They will cheat  you, hurt you, lie.
361	 SM%AGOL	 Master%s my friend.
362	 GOLLUM	 [Tauntingly] You don%t have any friends.  Nobody likes YOU...
363	 SM%AGOL	 [Covers his ears] Not listening. I%m  not listening.
364	 GOLLUM	 You%re a liar and a thief.
365	 SM%AGOL	 [Shaking his head] Nope.
366	 GOLLUM	 Mur%derer%!
367	 SM%AGOL	 [Starts to weep and whimper] Go away.
368	 GOLLUM	 Go away! [Cackles] HAHAHAHA!!
369	 SM%AGOL	 [Weeping and in a small voice] I hate  you. I hate you!
370	 GOLLUM	 [Fiercely] Where would you be without  me? *Gollum, gollum*. I saved us. It  was me. We survived because of me!
371	 SM%AGOL	 [Resolute] Not anymore.
372	 GOLLUM	 [Startled] What did you say?
373	 SM%AGOL	 Master looks after us now. We don%t  need you.
374	 GOLLUM	 What?
375	 SM%AGOL	 Leave now and never come back.
376	 GOLLUM	 No!!
377	 SM%AGOL	 [Louder] Leave now and never come back!
378	 GOLLUM	 [Growls and bares his teeth] Arrrgh!!!
379	 SM%AGOL	 LEAVE. NOW. AND. NEVER. COME. BACK!
380	 LEAVE. NOW. AND. NEVER. COME. BACK!	 
381	 SM%AGOL	 We... we told him to go away! And away  he goes, preciousss. [He hops around  in joy and does a little dance.] Gone,  gone, gone! Sm%agol is free!
382	 SM%AGOL	 Look! Look! See what Sm%agol finds!  Hehehe! Hahaha!
383	 SM%AGOL	 They are young. They are tender. They  are nice. Yes they are! Eat them! Eat  them!
384	 SAM	 You%ll make him sick, you will, behaving  like that! [Holding up the two rabbits]  There%s only one way to eat a brace  of coneys.
385	 SM%AGOL	 [Looking into the pot] Argh!! What%s  it doing! Stupid fat hobbit! It ruins  it!
386	 SAM	 What%s to ruin? There%s hardly any meat  on %em.
387	 SAM	 What we need is a few good taters.
388	 GOLLUM	 What%s taters, preciousss? What%s taters  uh?
389	 SAM	 PO-TAY-TOES! Boil %em. Mash %em. Stick  %em in a stew. Lovely big golden chips  with a nice piece of fried fish....
390	 SM%AGOL	 [Sticks out his tongue in disgust] Pbbbttt!!
391	 SAM	 Even you couldn%t say no to that. [He  takes a sip of the stew]
392	 SM%AGOL	 Oh yes we could! Spoil nice fish...  [scrambles up close to Sam] Give it  to usss rrraw... and wrrriggling! [Makes  sickeningly happy face.] You keep nasty  chips. [Hops away]
393	 SAM	 You%re hopeless. [Frodo follows the source of the sound.  Sam suddenly notices that Frodo is no  longer in his sight.]
394	 SAM	 Mr. Frodo? [He goes in search of Frodo and finds  him lying down near some bushes looking  at a Haradrim army marching across the  land. He moves to lie low beside Frodo.  Sm%agol also moves in beside Frodo.]
395	 SAM	 Who are they?
396	 GOLLUM	 Wicked men. Servants of Sauron. They  are called to Mordor. The Dark One is  gathering all armies to him. It won%t  be long now. He will soon be ready.
397	 SAM	 Ready to do what?
398	 GOLLUM	 To make his war. The last war that will  cover all the world in shadow.
399	 FRODO	 We%ve got to get moving. Come on, Sam.
400	 SAM	 [Suddenly grabs Frodo%s arm] Mr Frodo!  Look! It%s an Oliphaunt!
401	 SAM	 No one at home will believe this...
402	 FRODO	 [Looking around] Sm%agol? [Suddenly, pandemonium breaks out from  below; the soldiers are being ambushed.  Cloaked rangers are firing deadly arrows  at the soldiers and Oliphaunts from  behind bushes. One of the Oliphaunts  starts trumpeting and stomping towards  Frodo and Sam, swinging his huge trunk  and tusks. Faramir takes aim and shoots  a soldier. He falls from the Oliphaunt  and lands right behind Frodo and Sam,  dead.]
403	 FRODO	 We%ve lingered here too long. Come on,  Sam!
404	 SAM	 Ah! [He charges at Faramir but is grabbed  by another ranger and thrown down. A  sword appears at his throat. Faramir  appears.]
405	 FARAMIR	 Bind their hands. [Meanwhile, the Rohirrim refugees are  heading towards Helm%s Deep. Gimli is  on a horse, chatting with %owyn who  is leading it by the reins.]
406	 GIMLI	 It%s true you don%t see many Dwarf women.  And in fact, they are so alike in voice  and appearance, haha that they%re often  mistaken for Dwarf men.
407	 ARAGORN	 [Gestures and whispers] It%s the beards....
408	 GIMLI	 And this, in turn, has given rise to  the belief that there are no Dwarf women.  And that dwarves just spring out of  holes in the ground!
409	 %OWYN	 [Laughs gaily] Hahahaha!!
410	 GIMLI	 Hehehe! Which is of course ridiculous%  Whoa!!
411	 %OWYN	 Ooh! [She rushes forward to Gimli]
412	 GIMLI	 [Struggling to get up] It%s alright,  it%s alright. Nobody panic. That was  deliberate. It was deliberate.
413	 ARWEN (V.O.)	 The light of the Evenstar does not wax  and wane% It is mine to give to whom  I will... Like my heart% Go to sleep...
414	 [FLASHBACK	 Aragorn is lying on a chaise in Rivendell.  He opens his eyes and sees Arwen before  him, smiling down at him.]
415	 ARAGORN	 I am asleep. This is a dream.
416	 ARWEN	 [Bends down to kiss him] Then it is  a good dream. Sleep%
417	 ARAGORN	 Min l% pennich nin i aur hen telitha.  (You told me once that this day would  come.)
418	 ARWEN	 [Turns to look at Aragorn] % i vethed...  n% i onnad. Boe bedich go Frodo. Han  b%d l%n. (This is not the end... it  is the beginning. You must go with Frodo.  That is your path.)
419	 ARAGORN	 [Walks over to Arwen] Dolen i v%d o  nin. (My path is hidden from me.)
420	 ARWEN	 Si peliannen i v%d na dail l%n. Si boe  %-dhannathach. (It is already laid before  your feet. You cannot falter now.)
421	 ARAGORN	 Arwen% [Arwen hushes him, resting her fingers  on his lips. As her hands moves down  to rest on the Evenstar pendant around  Aragorn%s neck, he clasps her hand in  his and they gaze into each other%s  eyes.]
422	 ARWEN	 Ae %-esteliach nad... estelio han. Estelio  ammen. (If you trust nothing else...  trust this. Trust us.)
423	 %OWYN	 Where is she? The woman who gave you  that jewel.
424	 [ARAGORN SMILES AND SAYS NOTHING. FLASHBACK	 Elrond is speaking to Aragorn in Rivendell,  before he sets out with the Fellowship.]
425	 ELROND	 Our time here is ending. Arwen%s time  is ending. Let her go. Let her take  the ship into the west. Let her bear  away her love for you to the Undying  Lands. There it will be evergreen.
426	 ARAGORN	 But never more than a memory.
427	 ELROND	 I will not leave my daughter here to  die.
428	 ARAGORN	 She stays because she still has hope.
429	 ELROND	 She stays for YOU! She belongs with  her people!
430	 ARAGORN	 Idhren emmen menna gui ethwel. Hae o  auth a n%r a naeth. (You have a chance  for another life. Away from war... grief...  despair.)
431	 ARWEN	 Why are you saying this?
432	 ARAGORN	 I am mortal; you are Elfkind. It was  a dream, Arwen, nothing more.
433	 ARAGORN	 This belongs to you.
434	 ARWEN	 [Closes Aragorn%s hand over the Evenstar]  It was a gift. Keep it.
435	 %OWYN	 My lord?
436	 ARAGORN	 She is sailing to the Undying Lands,  with all that is left of her kin.
437	 GAMLING	 What is it? H%ma? [Their horses become restless.]
438	 H%MA	 [Looking around] I%m not sure. [A warg scout appears on a slope above  and charges at them. The warg attacks  H%ma and kills him.]
439	 GAMLING	 Wargs! [Just as it starts to turn on Gamling,  Legolas runs over and kills the warg  with an arrow. He then draws his knife  and kills the Orc.]
440	 LEGOLAS	 Argh! [Shouts to Aragorn] A scout!
441	 TH%ODEN	 What is it? What do you see?
442	 ARAGORN	 [Running back to Th%oden] Wargs! We  are under attack!
443	 ARAGORN	 Get them out of here!
444	 TH%ODEN	 All riders to the head of the column!
445	 GIMLI	 [Trying to mount Arod] Come on, get  me up here, I%m a rider! Argh!
446	 TH%ODEN	 [To %owyn] You must lead the people  to Helm%s Deep. And make haste!
447	 %OWYN	 I can fight!
448	 TH%ODEN	 No! You must do this... for me. [%owyn holds Th%oden%s gaze for a moment  and then turn to attend to the villagers.]
449	 TH%ODEN	 [To his men] Follow me! Yah!
450	 GIMLI	 [Tries to get Arod to move] Forward.  I mean, charge forward! March forward!  [Arod moves off with Gimli seated rather  unsteadily.] That%s it! Go on!
451	 %OWYN	 [To the villagers] Make for the lower  ground! Stick together!
452	 WARG-RIDERS	 Argh!!
453	 TH%ODEN	 CHARGE!!
454	 CHARGE!!	 [The Rohirrim and warg riders crash  head on and the battle begins. Th%oden  and company hack away at the warg riders.  In the midst of fighting, Gimli falls  off Arod. He turns to find a warg growling  at him.]
455	 GIMLI	 Bring your pretty face to my axe! [Just as the warg leaps at Gimli, Legolas  kills it with one shot.]
456	 GIMLI	 [Jumping back as the warg falls, outraged]  Argh! That one counts as mine!
457	 GIMLI	 Argh! Stinking creature. Argh! [As he tries to lift the warg off him,  an Orc leans over them both. Gimli kills  him quickly, twisting his neck, and  it lands on him also. Gimli sniffs at  the Orc and makes a face. He tries to  lift both the warg and Orc off him.  Just then, another warg comes upon him  and bares its teeth, ready to strike.
458	 ]	 
459	 GIMLI	 [Eyes widening] Ooh..! [Aragorn plucks a spear as he passes  on horseback and throws it at the warg.  It dies, landing on Gimli and adding  to the pile on top of him.]
460	 GIMLI	 [As the warg lands on him] Oooh!! [Th%oden stabs at a warg rider. Aragorn  is knocked off Hasufel and attacked  by Sharku. Aragorn tries to kill the  warg rider but Sharku blocks his attempt  and grabs Aragorn by the neck, while  the latter is half-dragged by the warg.  In the struggle, Sharku is thrown off  and he rips the Evenstar pendant from  Aragorn%s neck as he falls. Aragorn  tries to let go of the warg but finds  his wrist tangled with the saddle straps.  He tries unsuccessfully to disentangle  himself and is dragged closer and closer  to the edge of a cliff at great speed.  The warg runs right off the cliff and  they both disappear over the edge. The  battle is winding down as the Rohirrim  finish off the last few wargs and Orcs.]
461	 LEGOLAS	 [Looking around] Aragorn!
462	 GIMLI	 Aragorn? [They come near to the cliff and hear  Sharku wheezing and laughing]
463	 GIMLI	 [Standing over the dying Orc] Tell me  what happened and I will ease your passing.
464	 SHARKU	 He%s [cough] dead. [Laughs evilly] Took  a little tumble off the cliff.
465	 LEGOLAS	 [Looks towards the edge of the cliff,  and grabs Sharku] You lie!
466	 TH%ODEN	 [To his men] Get the wounded on horses.  The wolves of Isengard will return.  Leave the dead.
467	 TH%ODEN	 [Puts a hand on Legolas' shoulder] Come.
468	 REFUGEES	 Helm%s Deep! At last! There it is!
469	 OLD WOMAN	 [To %owyn] We%re safe, my lady! Thank  you!
470	 FREDA	 Mama!
471	 MORWEN	 %othain! Freda! [The three hug and cry with joy. Th%oden  and company returns from the battle  with warg riders]
472	 GAMLING	 Make way for Th%oden!
473	 SOLDIERS	 Sire!
474	 GAMLING	 Make way for the king! [%owyn rushes down to meet them]
475	 %OWYN	 [Looking about] So few. So few of you  have returned.
476	 TH%ODEN	 [Dismounting] Our people are safe. We  have paid for it with many lives.
477	 GIMLI	 [Going up to %owyn] My lady...
478	 %OWYN	 Lord Aragorn, where is he?
479	 GIMLI	 He fell... [%owyn is shaken and raises teary eyes  to Th%oden. The latter looks down and  then walks away, confirming her unasked  question.]
480	 TH%ODEN	 Draw all our forces behind the wall.  Bar the gate, and set a watch on the  surround.
481	 GAMLING	 What of those who cannot fight, my lord?  The women and children?
482	 TH%ODEN	 Get them into the caves. [Walks down  the steps and past a sewer gate] Saruman's  arm would have grown long indeed if  he thinks he can reach us here.
483	 GR%MA (V.O.)	 Helm%s Deep has one weakness. Its outer  wall is solid rock but for a small culvert  at its base which is little more than  a drain.
484	 GR%MA	 How? How can fire undo stone? What kind  of device could bring down the wall?
485	 SARUMAN	 If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep  will fall.
486	 GR%MA	 [Following Saruman] Even if it is breached,  it would take a number beyond reckoning,  thousands to storm the keep.
487	 SARUMAN	 Tens of thousands.
488	 GR%MA	 But, my lord, there is no such force.
489	 SARUMAN	 A new power is rising. Its victory is  at hand!
490	 SARUMAN	 This night, the land will be stained  with the blood of Rohan! March to Helms  Deep! Leave none alive!
491	 SARUMAN	 To war!! [The army cheers and roars even louder.]
492	 SARUMAN	 [Sneers] There will be no dawn for Men.
493	 PIPPIN	 Look! There%s smoke to the south!
494	 TREEBEARD	 There is always smoke rising from Isengard  these days.
495	 MERRY	 Isengard? [The two hobbits climb higher up onto  Treebeard for a better view.]
496	 TREEBEARD	 There was a time when Saruman would  walk in my woods. But now he has a mind  of metal and wheels. He no longer cares  for growing things.
497	 PIPPIN	 What is it?
498	 MERRY	 It%s Saruman%s army! The war has started.
499	 ARWEN	 [Kissing him on the lips] May the grace  of the Valar protect you.
500	 ARAGORN	 [Mumbles] Brego% [He grabs hold of Brego%s  mane, pulls himself onto the horse and  rides slowly to Helms Deep.]
501	 ELROND	 [Coming into her room] Arwen. [Arwen hears him and sits up.]
502	 ELROND	 Tollen i l%. I chair gwannar na Valannor.  Si bado, no c%rar. (Arwen, it is time.  The ships are leaving for Valinor. Go  now... before it is too late.)
503	 ARWEN	 I have made my choice.
504	 ELROND	 He is not coming back. Why do you linger  here when there is no hope?
505	 ARWEN	 There is still hope.
506	 ELROND	 [Walks towards window and looks out]  If Aragorn survives this war, you will  still be parted. If Sauron is defeated,  and Aragorn made king and all that you  hope for comes true, you will still  have to taste the bitterness of mortality.  Whether by the sword or the slow decay  of time, Aragorn will die.
507	 ELROND	 And there will be no comfort for you.  No comfort to ease the pain of his passing.  He will come to death, an image of the  splendor of the kings of men in glory  undimmed before the breaking of the  world.
508	 ELROND	 But you, my daughter, you will linger  on in darkness and in doubt. As nightfall  in winter that comes without a star.  Here you will dwell, bound to your grief,  under the fading trees, until all the  world is changed and the long years  of your life are utterly spent.
509	 ELROND	 [Tuning to Arwen] Arwen... there is  nothing for you here, only death.
510	 ELROND	 A im, %-'erin veleth l%n? (Do I not  also have your love?)
511	 ARWEN	 [Crying and moving into her father%s  embrace] Gerich meleth n%n, ada. (You  have my love, father)
512	 GALADRIEL	 I amar prestar aen... han mathon ne  nen, han mathon ne chae a han nostan  ned gwilith. (The world has changed...  I feel it in the water, I feel it in  the earth, I smell it in the air.) The  power of the enemy is growing. [Saruman  is communicating with Sauron via the  Palant%r.] Sauron will use his puppet  Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.  Isengard has been unleashed. [View of  Saruman's marching army] The eye of  Sauron now turns to Gondor, the last  free kingdom of men. [View of Osgiliath]  His war on this country will come swiftly.  He senses the Ring is close. The strength  of the Ringbearer is failing. In his  heart, Frodo begins to understand. [Close-up  of Galadriel] The quest will claim his  life. You know this. You have foreseen  it. It is the risk we all took.
513	 GALADRIEL (V.O.)	 In the gathering dark, the will of the  Ring grows strong. It works hard now  to find its way back into the hands  of men.
514	 GALADRIEL (V.O.)	 Men, who are so easily seduced by its  power. The young captain of Gondor has  but to extend his hands, take the Ring  for his own and the world will fall.  It is close now, so close to achieving  its goal.
515	 GALADRIEL (V.O.)	 For Sauron will have dominion of all  life on this Earth, even unto the ending  of the world. The time of the Elves  is over.
516	 GALADRIEL (V.O.)	 Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?  Do we let them stand alone?
517	 FARAMIR	 What news?
518	 MADRIL	 Our scouts report Saruman has attacked  Rohan. Th%oden%s people have fled to  Helm%s Deep. [Points at the map] But  we must look to our own borders. Faramir,  Orcs are on the move. Sauron is marshalling  an army. Easterlings and Southrons are  passing through the Black Gate.
519	 FARAMIR	 How many?
520	 MADRIL	 Some thousands. More come every day.
521	 FARAMIR	 Who%s covering the river to the north?
522	 MADRIL	 We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath, but  if the city is attacked, we won%t hold  it.
523	 FARAMIR	 [Tracing on the map] Saruman attacks  from Isengard. Sauron from Mordor. The  fight will come to men on both fronts.  Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us  soon. And he will strike hard. He knows  now we do not have the strength to repel  him.
524	 FARAMIR	 My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
525	 SAM	 Spies?! Now wait just a minute!
526	 FARAMIR	 Well if you%re not spies, then who are  you?
527	 FARAMIR	 Speak.
528	 FRODO	 We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins  is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.
529	 FARAMIR	 Your bodyguard?
530	 SAM	 His gardener.
531	 FARAMIR	 And where is your skulking friend? That  gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured  look.
532	 FRODO	 [The merest hesitation.] There was no  other.
533	 FRODO	 We set out from Rivendell with seven  companions. One we lost in M%ria. Two  were my kin. A Dwarf there was also,  and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son  of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
534	 FARAMIR	 [Intently] You%re a friend of Boromir?
535	 FRODO	 Yes... for my part.
536	 FARAMIR	 It will grieve you then to learn that  he is dead.
537	 FRODO	 [Shocked] Dead? How? When?
538	 FARAMIR	 As one of his companions, I%d hoped  you would tell me. [Pause] He was my  brother.
539	 GONDORIAN RANGER	 Captain Faramir. [whispers] We found  the third one.
540	 FARAMIR	 You must come with me. Now. [Frodo gets up and follow. They come  to the edge of the waterfall, overlooking  the Forbidden Pool.]
541	 FARAMIR	 [Pointing down] Down there. [Frodo looks down and sees Gollum diving  into the water.]
542	 FARAMIR	 To enter the forbidden pool bears the  penalty of death. [He gestures to archers  hidden in the bushes.] They wait for  my command.
543	 FARAMIR	 Shall I shoot? [Frodo looks stricken. Gollum emerges  from the pool onto a rock. He holds  a fish in his hand and starts singing,  slapping the fish on the rock as he  goes.]
544	 GOLLUM	 [singing] The rock and pool is nice  and cool, so juicy sweet! I only wish  [Whacks the fish on the rock] to catch  a fish [whacks], so juicy sweet! [The  fish almost wriggles out of his grasp  and he whacks it some more.]
545	 FRODO	 Wait! [Faramir stops] This creature  is bound to me. And I to him. He is  our guide. Please, let me go down to  him.
546	 FRODO	 Sm%agol. [Gollum turns round at Frodo%s  voice.] Master is here. Come, Sm%agol.  Trust master. Come!
547	 GOLLUM	 We must go now?
548	 FRODO	 Sm%agol, you must trust master. Follow  me, come on. Come. Come, Sm%agol. Nice  Sm%agol. That%s it. Come on.
549	 FRODO	 Don%t hurt him! Sm%agol don%t struggle!  Sm%agol listen to me!
550	 GOLLUM	 [wails] Master!! [A black cloth is brought over Gollum's  head. Frodo stares after them with a  stricken expression as Faramir leads  Gollum and his men away. Back in the  cave, Gollum is thrown down to the ground.  Crying, he crawls into a corner and  curls up into ball.]
551	 GOLLUM	 No! No!
552	 FARAMIR	 Where are you leading them? Answer me!
553	 GOLLUM	 [Cooing, his hand stroking his shoulder]  Sm%a%gol... Why does it cry, Sm%agol?
554	 SM%AGOL	 [Sobbing] Cruel men hurts us. Master  trickst us.
555	 GOLLUM	 Of course he did. I told you he was  tricksy. I told you he was false.
556	 SM%AGOL	 [Sobbing] Master is our friend... our  friend.
557	 GOLLUM	 Master betrayed us.
558	 SM%AGOL	 No, not its business. Leave us alone!
559	 GOLLUM	 [Hits his fist against the wall] Filthy  little hobbitses. They stole it from  us.
560	 SM%AGOL	 [Whimpers] No... No!
561	 FARAMIR	 What did they steal?
562	 GOLLUM	 [Turns to Faramir with a ferocious expression]  Myyy% PRECIOUSSS!! [He bares his teeth  and growls] Aaaarrrggghhh!!!
563	 SAM	 We have to get out of here. You go.  Go, now! You can do it. Use the Ring,  Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on.  Disappear.
564	 FRODO	 I can%t. You were right, Sam. You tried  to tell me, but% I%m sorry. The Ring%s  taking me Sam. If I put it on, he%ll  find me. He%ll see.
565	 SAM	 Mr. Frodo... [They both stand as Faramir enters.]
566	 FARAMIR	 [Unsheathes his sword] So... this is  the answer to all the riddles. Here  in the wild I have you. Two halflings  and a host of men at my call. The Ring  of power within my grasp.
567	 FARAMIR	 A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,  to show his quality.
568	 FRODO	 No!! [He runs away from Faramir]
569	 SAM	 Stop it! Leave him alone! Don%t you  understand? He%s got to destroy it.  That%s where we%re going. Into Mordor.  To the mountain of fire.
570	 DAMROD	 Osgiliath is under attack. They call  for reinforcements.
571	 SAM	 Please. It%s such a burden. Will you  not help him?
572	 DAMROD	 Captain?
573	 FARAMIR	 Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to  Gondor. [He turns to leave.]
574	 ARAGORN	 [Patting Brego on the neck] Mae carnen,  Brego, mellon n%n. (Well done, Brego,  my friend)
575	 REFUGEES	 He%s alive!
576	 GIMLI	 [Pushing his way through the crowd.]  Where is he? Where is he? Get out of  the way. I%m gonna kill him! [He sees  Aragorn.] You are the luckiest, the  canniest and the most reckless man I  ever knew! [He hugs Aragorn.] Bless  you, laddie!
577	 ARAGORN	 Gimli, where is the king? [Gimli gestures to the hall. As Aragorn  makes his way in, he runs into Legolas  who stands waiting.]
578	 LEGOLAS	 Le ab-dollen. (You%re late.) [They smile.  Legolas pauses and looks at Aragorn%s  wounds.] You look terrible.
579	 ARAGORN	 Hannon le. (Thank you.) [%owyn looks on and smiles even as tears  fill her eyes.]
580	 TH%ODEN	 A great host, you say?
581	 ARAGORN	 All Isengard is emptied
582	 TH%ODEN	 How many?
583	 ARAGORN	 Ten thousand strong at least.
584	 TH%ODEN	 Ten thousand?!
585	 ARAGORN	 It is an army bred for a single purpose:  to destroy the world of men. They will  be here by nightfall.
586	 TH%ODEN	 Let them come! [Walks away resolutely]
587	 TH%ODEN	 [to Gamling] I want every man and strong  lad able to bear arms to be ready for  battle by nightfall.
588	 TH%ODEN	 We will cover the causeway and the gate  from above. No army has ever breached  the Deeping Wall or set foot inside  the Hornburg.
589	 GIMLI	 This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.  These are Uruk-hai. Their armor is thick  and their shields broad.
590	 TH%ODEN	 I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.  I know how to defend my own keep.
591	 TH%ODEN	 They will break upon this fortress like  water on rock. Saruman%s hordes will  pillage and burn, we%ve seen it before.  Crops can be resown; homes rebuilt.  Within these walls, we will outlast  them.
592	 ARAGORN	 They do not come to destroy Rohan%s  crops or villages. They come to destroy  its people. Down to the last child.
593	 TH%ODEN	 [Draws close to Aragorn] What would  you have me do? Look at my men. Their  courage hangs by a thread. If this is  to be our end, then I would have them  make such an end as to be worthy of  remembrance.
594	 ARAGORN	 Send out riders, my lord. You must call  for aid.
595	 TH%ODEN	 And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We  are not so lucky in our friends as you.  The old alliances are dead.
596	 ARAGORN	 Gondor will answer.
597	 TH%ODEN	 Gondor? Where was Gondor when the Westfold  fell? Where was Gondor when our enemies  closed in around us? Where was Gon%  % No, my lord Aragorn, we are alone.  [He walks away, calling out orders]  Get the women and children into the  caves.
598	 GAMLING	 We need more time to lay provisions  for a siege, lord %
599	 TH%ODEN	 [Cutting him off] There is no time.  War is upon us!
600	 ROHAN CAPTAIN	 [to the soldiers] Secure the gate!
601	 TREEBEARD	 We Ents have not troubled about the  wars of men and wizards for a very long  time. But now something is about to  happen that has not happened for an  age... Ent Moot.
602	 MERRY	 What%s that?
603	 TREEBEARD	 'Tis a gathering.
604	 MERRY	 A gathering of what? [Merry and Pippin turns round as they  hear movement from the forest around  them. They see many more Ents like Treebeard  gathering.]
605	 TREEBEARD	 Beech, oak, chestnut, ash... Good, good,  good. Many have come. Now we must decide  if the Ents will go to war.
606	 SOLDIER 1	 Move back! Move to the caves!
607	 SOLDIER 2	 Keep moving!
608	 SOLDIER 3	 Quickly now! [Old men and young lads are being drafted  for war. The women and children say  their tearful and reluctant farewells  as their fathers, husbands and sons  are led away by soldiers. In the armoury,  weapons are being distributed. Aragorn  picks up a battered sword, looks at  it and tosses it back.]
609	 ARAGORN	 Farmer, farriers, stable boys. These  are no soldiers.
610	 GIMLI	 Most have seen too many winters.
611	 LEGOLAS	 Or too few. Look at them. They%re frightened.  I can see it in their eyes. [The men  around them fell silent. Legolas speaks  to Aragorn.] Boe a h%n: neled herain  dan caer menig! (And they should be...  Three hundred against ten thousand!)
612	 ARAGORN	 Si beriathar h%n. Amar n% ned Edoras.  (They have more hope of defending themselves  here than at Edoras.)
613	 LEGOLAS	 Aragorn, men i ndagor. H%n %-... ortheri.  Natha daged aen! (Aragorn, we are warriors.  They cannot win this fight. They are  all going to die!)
614	 ARAGORN	 Then I shall die as one them! [He pauses  and then walks away. Legolas makes as  if to go after him.]
615	 GIMLI	 [Puts a hand on Legolas] Let him go,  lad. Let him be.
616	 GAMLING	 Every villager able to wield a sword  has been sent to the armory. My lord?
617	 TH%ODEN	 Who am I, Gamling?
618	 GAMLING	 You are our king, sire.
619	 TH%ODEN	 And do you trust your king?
620	 GAMLING	 [Puts armour onto Th%oden] Your men,  my lord, will follow you to whatever  end.
621	 TH%ODEN	 To whatever end% Where is the horse  and the rider? Where is the horn that  was blowing? They have passed like rain  on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow.  The days have gone down in the west.  Behind the hills, into shadow. How did  it come to this?
622	 ARAGORN	 Give me your sword. What is your name?
623	 HALETH	 Haleth, son of H%ma, my lord. The men  are saying that we will not live out  the night. They say that it is hopeless..
624	 ARAGORN	 This is a good sword, Haleth, son of  H%ma.
625	 ARAGORN	 There is always hope. [Back at the armoury, Aragorn dons his  battle gear. His sword is handed to  him as he reaches for it. He nods and  accepts the sword from Legolas.]
626	 LEGOLAS	 We have trusted you this far. You have  not led us astray. Forgive me. I was  wrong to despair.
627	 ARAGORN	 %-moe edhored, Legolas. (There is nothing  to forgive, Legolas.)
628	 GIMLI	 If we had more time I%d get this adjusted.  [He drops the bundle and the chain mail  lands with its length right to the floor.]  It%s a little tight across the chest.
629	 LEGOLAS	 That is no Orc horn. [They run out to  the battlements.]
630	 BEREG	 [to another guard] Send for the king.  Open the gate!
631	 SOLDIER	 Open the gate! [An army of Lothl%rien Elves march up  the Causeway into the Hornburg. They  are led by Haldir. The Rohirrim soldiers  look upon them in wonderment and delight  as they pass.]
632	 TH%ODEN	 How is this possible?
633	 HALDIR	 I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.  An alliance once existed between Elves  and men. Long ago we fought and died  together. [He looks up to see Aragorn,  Legolas and Gimli running down the steps,  and smiles] We come to honor that allegiance.
634	 ARAGORN	 [He bows] Mae govannen, Haldir. (Welcome,  Haldir) [He grabs Haldir in a huge embrace.  Initially stunned, Haldir hugs him back  lightly.]
635	 ARAGORN	 You are most welcome! [Legolas and Haldir clasp each other  on the shoulder.]
636	 HALDIR	 [Turning to Th%oden] We are proud to  fight alongside men, once more.
637	 GIMLI	 [Grumbling and straining to look above  the wall.] You could have picked a better  spot.
638	 GIMLI	 Well lad, whatever luck you live by,  let%s hope it lasts the night.
639	 LEGOLAS	 Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
640	 GIMLI	 Let%s hope they last the night. [The marching and thumping grows louder  and louder. Lightning flashes and it  begins to rain. While the Uruk-hai army  continues to march at the fortress,  an Uruk-hai leader steps on a rock outcrop.]
641	 ARAGORN	 A Eruch%n, %-dano i faelas a hyn an  uben tanatha le faelas! (Show them no  mercy! For you shall receive none!)
642	 GIMLI	 [Jumping and straining to see] What%s  happening out there?
643	 LEGOLAS	 Shall I describe it to you? [Looks at  Gimli with a grin] Or would you like  me to find you a box?
644	 GIMLI	 [Laughs good-naturedly] Hehehehe!!
645	 ARAGORN	 Dartho! (Hold!) [The Uruk-hai army stop their roaring  and thumping. With a hollow groan, the  Uruk that was shot collapsed to the  ground. The other Uruk-hai bare their  teeth and roar with anger. With a cry,  the Uruk-hai leader thrusts his weapon  in the air and the Uruk-hai army starts  charging.]
646	 TH%ODEN	 So it begins.
647	 ARAGORN	 Tangado halad! (Prepare to fire!) [The Elves notch their arrow and aim.]
648	 LEGOLAS	 Faeg i-varv d%n na lanc a nu ranc. (Their  armor is weak at the neck and beneath  the arms.)
649	 ARAGORN	 Leithio i philinn! (Release the arrows!)
650	 GIMLI	 Did they hit anything?
651	 TH%ODEN	 Give them a volley.
652	 GAMLING	 [to the men] Fire!
653	 MAN-WITH-MISSING-EYE	 Fire! [More arrows are released. But the Uruk-hai  army keep advancing, with more replacing  those fallen.]
654	 ARAGORN	 Fire!
655	 GIMLI	 [Impatiently] Send them to me! C%mon!
656	 ARAGORN	 Pendraid! (Ladders!) [The Elves draw their blades in preparation  for combat. The first ladders are almost  reaching the walls with big nasty Uruk  Berserkers on top of them.]
657	 ARAGORN	 Swords! Swords!
658	 GIMLI	 Good! [Close combat begins as the Uruk-hai  climb over the wall.]
659	 GIMLI	 Legolas, two already! [Holding up two  fingers]
660	 LEGOLAS	 I%m on seventeen!
661	 GIMLI	 [Outraged] Argh! I%ll have no pointy-ear  outscoring me! [He turns to a Uruk just  climbing over the wall, whacking it  in the groin with his axe and killing  it as it falls.]
662	 LEGOLAS	 [Fires two arrows] Nineteen! [The Ent Moot is still in progress.  The Ents sway a little as they continue  to deliberate. Merry and Pippin are  sitting a distance away. Suddenly, Treebeard  nods and turns to the hobbits.]
663	 PIPPIN	 [Gesturing] Merry!
664	 TREEBEARD	 We have just agreed. [Long pause with  his eyes closed.]
665	 MERRY	 [Angles his head in query] Yes?
666	 TREEBEARD	 I have told your names to the Ent moot  and we have agreed % you are not Orcs.
667	 PIPPIN	 Well, that%s good news.
668	 MERRY	 [impatiently] And what about Saruman?  Have you come to a decision about HIM?
669	 TREEBEARD	 [Waving a hand] Now don%t be hasty,  Master Meriadoc.
670	 MERRY	 Hasty? Our friends are out there! They  need our help! They cannot fight this  war on their own.
671	 TREEBEARD	 War, yes% It affects us all. But you  must understand, young hobbit. It takes  a loong time to say anything in ooold%  Entish. [Merry and Pippin roll their  eyes in disgruntlement.] And we never  say anything% unless it is worth taking  a looong% time to say.
672	 GIMLI	 Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty!  Twenty-one! Twenty-two!
673	 ARAGORN	 Na fennas! (Causeway!) [Directs the  Elf archers to aim at the Uruk-hai column.]
674	 TH%ODEN	 Is this it? Is this all you can conjure,  Saruman?
675	 ARAGORN	 Togo hon dad, Legolas! (Bring him down,  Legolas!) [Legolas shoots the Uruk-hai  in the shoulder but the latter keeps  going] Dago hon! Dago hon! (Kill him!  Kill him!)
676	 TH%ODEN	 Brace the Gate! Hold them! Stand firm!
677	 GIMLI	 Aragorn!! Argh! [He is soon overpowered. Aragorn gets  up and sees Gimli falling.]
678	 ARAGORN	 Gimli! [He yells to the Elves behind  him] Hado i philinn! (Hurl the arrows!)
679	 ARAGORN	 Herio! (Charge!) [Aragorn leads the Elves in a charge  towards the Uruk-hai streaming in. He  rushes to Gimli%s side and picks him  up. At the top of the battlements, Legolas  grabs a shield and sends it sliding  across the ground. He then hops onto  it and surfs down the steps, releasing  three arrows as he goes, and kicking  the shield to stab an Uruk-hai as he  lands at the bottom.]
680	 TREEBEARD	 The Ents cannot hold back this storm.  We must weather such things as we have  always done.
681	 MERRY	 How can that be your decision?!
682	 TREEBEARD	 This is not our war.
683	 MERRY	 But you're part of this world! Aren%t  you?! [The Ents look at one another,  taken back] You must help, please! You  must do something!
684	 TREEBEARD	 You are young and brave, Master Merry.  But your part in this tale is over.  Go back to your home.
685	 PIPPIN	 Maybe Treebeard%s right. We don%t belong  here, Merry. It's too big for us. What  can we do in the end? We've got the  Shire. Maybe we should go home.
686	 MERRY	 [Looking into the distance.] The fires  of Isengard will spread. And the woods  of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.  And all that was once green and good  in this world will be gone. [Turns to  Pippin and puts a hand on his shoulder]  There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
687	 GAMLING	 Aragorn! Fall back to the Keep! Get  your men out of there!
688	 ARAGORN	 Na Barad! Na Baraad! Haldir, na Barad!  (To the Keep! Pull back to the Keep!  Haldir, to the Keep!)
689	 GIMLI	 [Protesting] What are you doing? Argh!  What are you stopping for!
690	 [HALDIR HACKS AT A FEW URUK AS HE TURNS TOWARDS	 THE GATE. SUDDENLY, HE IS STABBED IN HIS ARM.]
691	 THE GATE. SUDDENLY, HE IS STABBED IN HIS ARM.]	 With a grimace, he kills the Uruk-hai  and looks down as his wound in seeming  disbelief. An Uruk-hai comes up from  behind him unnoticed and slices him  on the neck. As Haldir goes down, he  looks around him and sees his kin fallen  among dead Uruk-hai.]
692	 ARAGORN	 [Sees Haldir falling] HALDIR!! [He runs  up the steps to Haldir%s side and catches  him and he collapses. Haldir's head  rolls back, his eyes empty and unseeing.  Aragorn bows his head in grief. Then  with a cry, he jumps onto a ladder and  swings down to the ground, killing as  he goes.]
693	 GAMLING	 Brace the gate!
694	 SOLDIER	 Hold them!
695	 TH%ODEN	 [Drawing his sword] To the gate! Draw  your swords!
696	 GAMLING	 Make way! We cannot hold much longer.
697	 TH%ODEN	 Hold them!
698	 ARAGORN	 [Runs up and stabs away at the Uruk-hai  through the broken gate] How long do  you need?
699	 GAMLING	 Brace the gate!
700	 TH%ODEN	 As long as you can give me!
701	 ARAGORN	 Gimli!
702	 THEODEN	 Timbers! Brace the Gate! [Aragorn and Gimli slip out a side exit  and stand on a ledge just to the side  of the main gate. Aragorn peeks over,  seeing the large band of Uruk-hai storming  the gate.]
703	 GIMLI	 Come on! We can take %em!
704	 ARAGORN	 It%s a long way. [Gimli takes a peek and then steps back.]
705	 GIMLI	 [Mumbles] Toss me.
706	 ARAGORN	 What?
707	 GIMLI	 I cannot jump the distance! You%ll have  to toss me!
708	 GIMLI	 Oh! [Gimli stays Aragorn%s hand] Don%t  tell the Elf.
709	 ARAGORN	 Not a word. [He tosses Gimli to the head of the  Causeway and then leaps over.]
710	 GIMLI	 [Making quick work of killing the Uruk-hai]
711	 ARGH!!	 
712	 TH%ODEN	 Shore up the door!
713	 SOLDIER 1	 Make way!
714	 SOLDIER 2	 Follow me to the barricade.
715	 SOLDIER 3	 Watch our backs!
716	 SOLDIER 4	 Throw another one over here!
717	 TH%ODEN	 Higher! [Men are bracing the gate with wood  and nails. Aragorn and Gimli continue  to fight off the Uruk-hai just outside.  Meanwhile the Uruk-hai load and fires  enormous hooks over the battlements.  Hundred of Uruk-hai climb onto super-ladders  as they are pulled up towards the walls,  the super-ladders locking onto the edge  of the battlements with their steel  grips. Legolas takes aim as another  super-ladder is being pulled up and  shoots away one of the ropes. The ladder  falls back onto the Uruk-hai army.]
718	 SOLDIER	 Hold fast the gate!]
719	 TH%ODEN	 [Through a crack in the gate] Gimli!  Aragorn! Get out of there!
720	 LEGOLAS	 Aragorn! [He throws them a rope] [Aragorn grabs Gimli in one hand and  the rope with the other as they are  pulled up the wall. Just then the Uruk-hai  load and fires enormous hooks over the  battlements. Hundred of Uruk-hai climb  onto super-ladders as they are pulled  up towards the walls, the super-ladders  locking onto the edge of the battlements  with their steel grips. Legolas takes  aim as another super-ladder is being  pulled up and shoots away one of the  ropes. The ladder falls back onto the  Uruk-hai army.]
721	 TH%ODEN	 Pull everybody back! Pull them back!
722	 GAMLING	 Fall back! Fall back!
723	 TH%ODEN	 They%ve broken through! The castle is  breached. Retreat!
724	 GAMLING	 Fall back!
725	 TH%ODEN	 Retreat!
726	 ARAGORN	 Hurry! Inside! Get them inside!
727	 GAMLING	 Into the Keep! [They all run towards the keep, Legolas  firing two arrows into the Uruk-hai  army as he goes.]
728	 TREEBEARD	 I will leave you at the western borders  of the forest. You can make your way  north to your homeland from there.
729	 PIPPIN	 Wait! Stop! Stop! [Treebeard comes to  a stop.] Turn around. Turn around. Take  us south!
730	 TREEBEARD	 South? But that will lead you past Isengard.
731	 PIPPIN	 Yes. Exactly. If we go south we can  slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer  we are to danger, the farther we are  from harm. It%s the last thing he%ll  expect.
732	 TREEBEARD	 Mmmm. That doesn%t make sense to me.  But then, you are very small. Perhaps  you%re right. South it is then. Hold  on, little Shirelings. I always like  going south. Somehow it feels like going  down hill.
733	 MERRY	 Are you mad? We%ll be caught!
734	 PIPPIN	 No we won%t. Not this time. [Faramir and company draws close to  Osgiliath.]
735	 RANGER 1	 Look! Osgiliath burns!
736	 RANGER 2	 Mordor has come.
737	 FRODO	 [With tears in his eyes] The Ring will  not save Gondor. It has only the power  to destroy. Please, let me go.
738	 FARAMIR	 Hurry. [He presses them on]
739	 FRODO	 Faramir, you must let me go! [Frodo and Sam are pushed on towards  Osgiliath]
740	 TREEBEARD	 And a little family of field mice that  climb up sometimes and they tickle me  awfully. They%re always trying to get  somewhere where they % Oh!! [He sees  the desolated landscape of tree stumps  that used to be forested grounds] Many  of these trees were my friends. Creatures  I had known from nut and acorn.
741	 PIPPIN	 I%m sorry, Treebeard.
742	 TREEBEARD	 [With tears in his eyes] They had voices  of their own. [His gaze turns to the  treeless Isengard and its smoking caverns]  Saruman! A wizard should know better!
743	 TREEBEARD	 There is no curse in Elvish, Entish  or the tongues of men for this treachery.  My business is with Isengard tonight.  With rock and stone!
744	 MERRY	 Yes!
745	 TREEBEARD	 Hoorarooom... Come my friends. The Ents  are going to war. It is likely that  we go to our doom. Last march of the  Ents!
746	 MADRIL	 Faramir, Orcs have taken the eastern  shore. Their numbers are too great.  By nightfall we%ll be overrun.
747	 SAM	 Mr Frodo!
748	 FRODO	 It%s calling to him, Sam. His eye is  almost on me.
749	 SAM	 Hold on, Mr. Frodo% You'll be alright...
750	 FARAMIR	 Take them to my father. Tell him Faramir  sends a mighty gift. A weapon that will  change our fortunes in this war.
751	 SAM	 Do you want to know what happened to  Boromir? You want to know why your brother  died? He tried to take the Ring from  Frodo! After swearing an oath to protect  him, he tried to kill him! The Ring  drove your brother mad!
752	 RANGER	 Watch out! [A boulder crashes into a tower overhead  and shatters it. Suddenly, Frodo%s eyes  roll up and he stares at Faramir strangely.]
753	 SAM	 Mr Frodo?
754	 FRODO	 [In a faraway voice] They%re here. They%ve  come.
755	 FARAMIR	 [Looking up] NAZG%L!! [He grabs the  hobbits and thrusts them into a corner.]  Stay here. Keep out of sight. [To his  men] Take cover!
756	 TH%ODEN	 The fortress is taken. It is over.
757	 ARAGORN	 [Carrying a table with Legolas to shore  up the door of the hall] You said this  fortress would never fall while your  men defend it! They still defend it!  They have died defending it!
758	 WOMAN	 They are breaking in!
759	 ARAGORN	 Is there no other way for the women  and children to get out of the caves?  [There is no answer.] Is there no other  way?
760	 GAMLING	 There is one passage. It leads into  the mountains. But they will not get  far. The Uruk-hai are too many.
761	 ARAGORN	 Send word for the women and children  to make for the mountain pass. And barricade  the entrance.
762	 TH%ODEN	 So much death. What can men do against  such reckless hate?
763	 ARAGORN	 [Pause] Ride out with me. Ride out and  meet them.
764	 TH%ODEN	 [A light of determination shines in  his eyes] For death and glory.
765	 ARAGORN	 For Rohan. For your people.
766	 GIMLI	 The sun is rising. [Aragorn looks up at a window to see  faint light streaming through. He recalls  Gandalf's words.]
767	 GANDALF (V.O.)	 Look to my coming at first light on  the fifth day. At dawn, look to the  east.
768	 TH%ODEN	 Yes. Yes! The horn of Helm Hammerhand  shall sound in the deep one last time!
769	 GIMLI	 Yes! [Gimli runs up the steps to the  horn of Helm Hammerhand]
770	 TH%ODEN	 Let this be the hour when we draw swords  together. Fell deeds awake. Now for  wrath! Now for ruin! And a red dawn!
771	 TH%ODEN	 FORTH EORLINGAS!!
772	 FORTH EORLINGAS!!	 [Th%oden leads the charge out of the  keep into the Hornburg, slashing away  at the Uruk-hai as they go. Without  pause, they storm out of the gate and  down the Causeway, right into the column  of waiting Uruk-hai. In the midst of  battle, Aragorn looks east and sees  a white rider against the rising sun]
773	 ARAGORN	 Gandalf.
774	 GANDALF	 Th%oden king stands alone.
775	 %OMER	 [Coming up from behind] Not alone. [He  raises a hand] Rohirrim!!
776	 TH%ODEN	 [Looking to the east] %omer!
777	 %OMER	 To the king! [The Rohirrim and the White Rider charge  down the slope. Half the Uruk-hai army  turns to face the challenge, bearing  their spears down towards the riders.  As the riders draw closer, the sun rises  behind them, momentarily blinding the  Uruk-hai who raise the hands (and spears)  to shield their eyes. The riders crash  right into the Uruk-hai and engage them  in battle.]
778	 PIPPIN	 Yes!
779	 TREEBEARD	 A hit. A fine hit! [Two Ents rock a wooden structure and  push it over into the caverns below,  smashing against the rock. Some Orcs  fire flamed-tipped arrows at an Ent,  setting him on fire. Saruman continues  to look about from his balcony, helpless.  Some Ents are now breaking away at a  dam.]
780	 TREEBEARD	 Break the dam! Release the river! [The dam is broken and Saruman looks  up to see the river rushing down the  slope towards Isengard, washing away  Orcs and wooden structures in its path.
781	 ]	 
782	 MERRY	 Pippin, hold on! [The hobbits tighten  their hold on top of Treebeard]
783	 TREEBEARD	 Hold on, little hobbits! [Treebeard braces himself against the  flood. As the water rushes over Isengard,  an Ent rushes in and thrusts his burning  body into the water. The water rushes  into the caverns, washing away the bridges,  mechanisms and structures within.]
784	 SAM	 What are you doing? Where are you going?!
785	 [SLOW MOTION	 Frodo walks up some stairs and stands  on a bridge. A Nazg%l on a Fell beast  emerges in front of him. Frodo stares  at the Nazg%l, fixated. Feeling the  call of the Ring, he holds it up. Faramir  watches the unfolding tableau from below.  As Frodo moves to put the Ring on his  finger and the Nazg%l flies closer and  closer, Sam runs up and knocks Frodo  over. Faramir releases an arrow and  shoots the Fell Beast. Frodo and Sam  roll down the stairs. As they come to  a stop at the bottom, Frodo holds Sam  in a death grip, yells and points Sting  at his throat, his eyes livid with madness  and anger that someone would try to  take the Ring away.]
786	 FRODO	 Aaarrgghh!!!
787	 SAM	 [With tears running down his face] It%s  me. It%s your Sam. Don%t you know your  Sam?
788	 FRODO	 [Slowly and with despair] I can%t do  this, Sam.
789	 SAM	 [Getting up slowly] I know. It%s all  wrong. By rights we shouldn%t even be  here. But we are. [He stands and leans  against a wall, looking out into the  distance.] It%s like in the great stories,  Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered.  Full of darkness and danger they were.  And sometimes you didn%t want to know  the end. Because how could the end be  happy? [Images of the riders winning  the battle against the Uruk-hai at Helm%s  Deep] How could the world go back to  the way it was when so much bad had  happened?
790	 TH%ODEN	 Victory! We have victory! [He raises  his sword with a victorious cry]
791	 SAM	 But in the end, it%s only a passing  thing, this shadow. [The women and children  welcome the men as they return. %owyn  runs up to Aragorn and embraces him,  crying tears of relief.] Even darkness  must pass. A new day will come. [Isengard  is flooded. Merry and Pippin looks on  from their perch on Treebeard. On the  balcony, Saruman stumbles back into  his chamber] And when the sun shines  it will shine out the clearer. Those  were the stories that stayed with you.  That meant something, even if you were  too small to understand why. But I think,  Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now.  Folk in those stories had lots of chances  of turning back only they didn%t. They  kept going because they were holding  on to something.
792	 FRODO	 What are we holding on to, Sam?
793	 SAM	 There%s some good in this world, Mr.  Frodo. And it%s worth fighting for.
794	 FARAMIR	 I think at last we understand one another,  Frodo Baggins.
795	 MADRIL	 You know the laws of our country, the  laws of your father. If you let them  go, your life will be forfeit.
796	 FARAMIR	 Then it is forfeit. Release them. [Sam shakes the ranger%s hand from his  shoulder. Frodo looks up at Faramir  with gladness. Over in the realm of  Rohan, Gandalf, Th%oden and company  ride to the top of a slope, looking  towards the Mountain of Fire in the  distance.]
797	 GANDALF	 Sauron%s wrath will be terrible, his  retribution swift. The battle for Helm%s  Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth  is about to begin. All our hopes now  lie with two little hobbits. Somewhere  in the wilderness.
798	 SAM	 I wonder if we%ll ever be put into songs  or tales.
799	 FRODO	 What?
800	 SAM	 I wonder if people will ever say, %let%s  hear about Frodo and the Ring.% And  they%ll say %yes, that%s one of my favorite  stories. Frodo was really courageous,  wasn%t he, dad.% %Yes, my boy, the most  famousest of hobbits. And that%s saying  alot.%
801	 FRODO	 Huh, you left out one of the chief characters  % Samwise the Brave. I want to hear  more about Sam.
802	 FRODO	 Frodo wouldn%t have got far without  Sam.
803	 SAM	 Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldn%t make fun.  I was being serious.
804	 FRODO	 [smiling] So was I. [He turns to walk  on]
805	 SAM	 [Dreamily] Samwise the Brave. [He gives  his backpack a heave and follows Frodo]
806	 FRODO	 Sm%agol!
807	 SAM	 We%re not gonna wait for you. Come on!
808	 SM%AGOL	 Master... Master looks after us. Master  wouldn%t hurt us.
809	 GOLLUM	 Master broke his promise.
810	 SM%AGOL	 Don%t ask Sm%agol. Poor, poor Sm%agol.
811	 GOLLUM	 Master betrayed us! Wicked, tricksy,  false. We ought to wring his filthy  little neck. [Twists the branch of a  tree] Kill him! Kill him! Kill them  both. And then we take the precious  and we be the master.
812	 SM%AGOL	 [Scuttles and hides behind a tree] The  fat hobbit, he knows. Eyes always watching.
813	 GOLLUM	 Then we stabs them out. Put out his  eyeses. And make HIM crawl.
814	 SM%AGOL	 [Bites on his finger and nods eagerly]  Yes! Yes! Yes!
815	 GOLLUM	 Kill them both.
816	 SM%AGOL	 Yes! No no! [Backs away against a tree]  It%s too risky, it%s too risky.
817	 SAM	 Where%s he gone? Hey Gollum, where are  you?
818	 FRODO	 Sm%agol?
819	 GOLLUM	 [Softly and sinisterly] We could let  HER do it.
820	 SM%AGOL	 Yes. She could do it.
821	 GOLLUM	 Yes, precious she could. And then we  takes it once they%re dead.
822	 SM%AGOL	 Once they%re dead%
823	 GOLLUM	 Shh% [He pops out from hiding in front  of the hobbits.]
824	 SM%AGOL	 Come on, hobbits. Long ways to go yet.  Sm%agol will show you the way.
825	 GOLLUM	 Follow me. [ Camera pans up over the forest and  Ephel D%ath to reveal the desolation  of Mordor. To the left of the frame  is the glowing Eye of Sauron atop Barad-d%r,  and to the right of the frame is the  fiery Mount Doom. Three Fell Beasts  circle the dark skies. Lightning flashes  as the scene fades to black.]
