20|Regie|[Camera pans over the Misty Mountains as voices drift in from the background.]|2
22|GANDALF|You cannot pass!|2
24|FRODO|Gandalf!|2
26|GANDALF|I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the Flame of Anor!|2
28|Regie|[Camera pans closer to the mountain side.]|2
30|GANDALF|Argh! Go back to the shadow. The Dark Fire will not avail you, Flame of Ud%n! [Camera zooms in through the mountain and focuses on Gandalf and the Balrog on the bridge of Khazad-d%m. The Balrog strikes down on Gandalf with its flaming sword. Gandalf parries the blow with Glamdring, shattering the Balrog%s sword.] YOU% SHALL NOT... PASS!!!|2
32|Regie|[Gandalf strikes his staff onto the bridge. As the Balrog steps forward, the bridge collapses from under it and the demon plunges backward into the chasm. Gandalf, exhausted, leans on his staff and watches the Balrog fall then turns to follow the others. At the last minute, the flaming whip lashes up from the depths of the abyss and winds around Gandalf%s ankle, dragging him over the edge. He clings onto the bridge but is straining to keep his grip.]|2
34|GANDALF|Argh!|2
36|Regie|[Frodo rushes forward but Boromir restrains him.]|2
38|BOROMIR|No! No!|2
40|FRODO|Gandalf!|2
42|GANDALF|Fly, you fools!|2
44|Regie|[Gandalf loses his grip and falls into the chasm]|2
46|FRODO|Noooooooooooooooo!!!!|2
48|Regie|[Gandalf loses his grip and falls into the chasm]|2
50|FRODO|[Calls after Gandalf as he falls into the abyss] Gaaandaaaaalf!!|2
52|Regie|[Gandalf falls after the Balrog and grabs hold of his sword Glamdring on his way down. As they continue to plunge into the depths, Gandalf hacks away at the Balrog even as it thrashes and bounces off the walls. They continue to plunge at great speed, sometimes with Gandalf clinging to the horn of the demon. The battling pair then falls into an enormous cavern and plunges into the water. Just then Frodo awakens as if from a nightmare.]|2
54|FRODO|Gandalf!|2
56|SAM|What is it, Mr. Frodo?|2
58|FRODO|Nothing. Just a dream. [Lies back down.]|2
60|Regie|[Frodo and Sam climbs over the rocky terrain Emyn Muil. They look into the distance at the Mountain of Fire.]|2
62|SAM|Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth we don%t want to see any closer, and the one place we%re trying to get to. It%s just where we can%t get. Let%s face it, Mr. Frodo, we%re lost. I don%t think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.|2
64|FRODO|He didn%t mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam... but they did.|2
66|Regie|[Suddenly Frodo feels and sees the Eye zooming in on him. He gasps and pants as he backs away.]|2
68|SAM|Mr. Frodo? It%s the Ring, isn%t it?|2
70|FRODO|It%s getting heavier. [Clutches the Ring by his chest and sits down, still panting. He then fumbles for his water bottle and takes a sip.]|2
72|FRODO|What food have we got left?|2
74|SAM|Well, let me see. [He takes out a package of lembas bread from his pack] Oh yes, lovely % Lembas bread. And look! [He digs deeper into his pack] More lembas bread.|2
76|Regie|[Sam shows another package. He then breaks off a piece and tosses it to Frodo, and munches on a piece himself.]|2
78|SAM|I don't usually hold with foreign food, but this Elvish stuff, it%s not bad.|2
80|FRODO|[smiles] Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it Sam?|2
82|Regie|[Sam smiles back, and then looks ominously towards Mordor.]|2
84|SAM|Those rain clouds might.|2
86|Regie|[They continue trekking through difficult terrain, often huddling underneath their cloaks.]|2
88|SAM|[Looks around] This looks strangely familiar.|2
90|FRODO|[Exasperated] It%s because we%ve been here before! We%re going in circles.|2
92|SAM|Ah! What's that 'orrid stink? I'll warrant there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you smell it?|2
94|FRODO|Yes. I can smell it. [Drops to a whisper] We%re not alone.|2
96|Regie|[NIGHTTIME Frodo and Sam are sleeping. A dark shape appears on top of the cliff. The creature Gollum has appeared and is making his way down to the hobbits.]|2
98|GOLLUM|The thieves! The thieves! The filthy little thieves! Where is it? Where isss it? They stole it from us. My preciousss. [Gollum creeps closer and closer.] Curse them! We hates them! It%s ours, it is... and we wantssss it!|2
100|Regie|[Gollum reaches out his hand towards the hobbits. Suddenly the hobbits spring up, grab hold of Gollum%s arms and pull him down. Amidst the struggle, Gollum wriggles loose and leaps onto Frodo. As Frodo falls back, the chain and Ring around his neck is revealed and Gollum jumps straight for the Ring. Sam tries to grab at him but is knocked away. Gollum now jumps on top of Frodo and tries to reach for the Ring even as Frodo grabs his hands and tries to push him away. Gollum%s cheeks puff with exertion as he struggles with Frodo, his enormous eyes fixed on the Ring. Sam grabs hold of Gollum again and tears him away from Frodo. Gollum then turns around and bites Sam on the shoulder, wriggles around and clasps his arms around Sam%s neck and legs around his waist in a death grip. Frodo unsheathes Sting and holds it to Gollum's throat.]|2
102|FRODO|[menacingly] This is Sting. You%ve seen it before, haven%t you... Gollum! Release him or I%ll cut your throat!|2
104|Regie|[Slowly, Gollum loosens his grip on Sam and as the latter disentangles himself, Gollum wails. In the next scene, Gollum is being dragged with Sam's Elvish rope around his neck, wailing and writhing in pain.]|2
106|GOLLUM|It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty Elves twisted it. Take it off us!|2
108|SAM|Quiet you!|2
110|Regie|[Sam tugs fiercely at the rope. Gollum cries some more and collapses onto his back. Sam turns to Frodo in dismay.]|2
112|SAM|It%s hopeless! Every Orc in Mordor%s going to hear this racket! Let%s just tie him up and leave him.|2
114|GOLLUM|No! That would kill us! Kill us!|2
116|SAM|It%s no more than you deserve!|2
118|FRODO|Maybe he does deserve to die, but now that I see him, I do pity him.|2
120|GOLLUM|[Begging] We be nice to them if they be nice to us. Take it off us. We swears to do what you wants. We swears.|2
122|FRODO|There%s no promise you can make that I can trust.|2
124|GOLLUM|We swears to serve the master of the preciousss. We swears on... on the precious. *Gollum. Gollum.*|2
126|FRODO|The Ring is treacherous. It will hold you to your word.|2
128|GOLLUM|Yes... on the preciousss. On the preciousss.|2
130|SAM|I don%t believe you! [Gollum backs away, frightened, and climbs onto a boulder] Get down! I said, down!|2
132|Regie|[Sam jerks strongly at the rope as Gollum tries to get away from him. He crashes onto the ground, choking.]|2
134|FRODO|Sam!|2
136|SAM|He%s trying to trick us! We let him go he%ll throttle us in our sleep!|2
138|Regie|[Gollum lies panting and holding his throat. He backs away, frightened, as Frodo approaches him.]|2
140|FRODO|You know the way to Mordor?|2
142|GOLLUM|[nods warily] Yes...|2
144|FRODO|You%ve been there before?|2
146|GOLLUM|[nods again] Yes...|2
148|Regie|[Frodo reaches out and takes the rope noose off Gollum%s neck. Gollum seems surprised and relieved.]|2
150|FRODO|You will lead us to the Black Gate.|2
152|Regie|[Gollum scrambles off in the direction of Morannon and the hobbits follow in his wake.]|2
154|Sprechertext||2
156|Regie|[A band of Uruk-hai marches across the plain, with two hobbits bound to the backs of two Uruk-hai. Pippin tries to call to Merry, who is unconscious with a gash on his right brow.]|2
158|PIPPIN|Merry. Merry! [He receives no response.]|2
160|Regie|[Suddenly, an Uruk-hai puts up his hand and signals a stop.]|2
162|UGL%K|What is it? What do you smell?|2
164|MAN-FLESH URUK|[sniffs the air] Man-flesh.|2
166|PIPPIN|[quietly to himself] Aragorn!|2
168|UGL%K|They've picked up our trail! Let's move!|2
170|Regie|[The Uruk-hai quicken their pace. Pippin struggles to reach his Elven brooch with his teeth. He then tears it off his cloak and drops it onto the ground. A foot stomps onto the brooch but it remains unbroken and visible on the grass.]|2
172|Regie|[Aragorn is lying with his eyes closed and ear pressed to the ground, listening for the sound of footsteps.]|2
174|ARAGORN|Their pace has quickened. [He looks up.] They must have caught our scent. Hurry! [He runs off.]|2
176|LEGOLAS|Come on, Gimli! [Looks back at Gimli and then runs after Aragorn]|2
178|GIMLI|[pauses in his steps and huffs] Three days% and nights% pursuit. No food. No rest. And no sign of our quarry but what bare rock can tell. [Runs after his companions.]|2
180|Regie|[The Three Hunters run across rocks and plains, with Aragorn in the lead, followed by Legolas and Gimli. From time to time, Legolas looks back to make sure that Gimli is keeping up. Aragorn suddenly bends down to pick up an Elven brooch from the ground.]|2
182|ARAGORN|Not idly do the leaves of L%rien fall.|2
184|LEGOLAS|[stops and turns to Aragorn.] They may yet be alive.|2
186|ARAGORN|Less than a day ahead of us. Come! [Runs off again]|2
188|Regie|[Gimli stumbles from behind some rocks and rolls to the ground]|2
190|LEGOLAS|Come, Gimli! We are gaining on them!|2
192|GIMLI|[Panting] I am wasted on cross-country! We dwarves are natural sprinters! Very dangerous over short distances!|2
194|Regie|[The trackers come over a hill and pause as they gaze across the plains below.]|2
196|Sprechertext|                         |2
198|ARAGORN|Rohan. Home of the horse-lords. There is something strange at work here. Some evil gives speed to these creatures, sets its will against us.|2
200|Regie|[Legolas runs ahead and looks out to the horizon.]|2
202|ARAGORN|Legolas, what do your Elf eyes see?|2
204|LEGOLAS|The Uruks turn northeast. They%re taking the hobbits to Isengard!|2
206|ARAGORN|Saruman.|2
208|Sprechertext||2
210|Regie|[The tower of Orthanc stands amidst the smoking caverns of Isengard. Saruman stands in his chamber, communicating with the Dark Lord through the Palant%r.]|2
212|SARUMAN (V.O.)|The world is changing. [View changes to the tower of Barad-d%r, with its huge Orc armies on a bridge.] Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor? To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?|2
214|Regie|[Camera pans upwards along the height of the tower of Barad-d%r until the flaming Eye is in view.]|2
216|SARUMAN (V.O.)|Together, my lord Sauron, we shall rule this Middle-earth.|2
218|Regie|[The trees around Isengard are being ripped down, chopped up and used to feed huge furnaces. The caverns of Isengard glow with the fires of industry, sounds of hammering fill the air and molten iron is poured into casts to forge weapons.]|2
220|SARUMAN (V.O.)|The old world will burn in the fires of industry. The forests will fall. A new order will rise. We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc. We have only to remove those who oppose us.|2
222|Regie|[Saruman stands in the midst of a gathering of Dunlanders.]|2
224|SARUMAN|The horsemen took your land. They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.|2
226|DUNLAND MAN|Murderers!|2
228|SARUMAN|Take back the lands they stole from you! Burn every village!|2
230|CROWD|[Roars with approval] Argh!!|2
232|Regie|[They stomp off to destroy the villages of Rohan as Saruman stands coldly still among the stampede. A Rohan village is in pandemonium as people try to escape the on-coming pillage.]|2
234|SARUMAN (V.O.)|It will begin in Rohan. Too long have these peasants stood against you. But no more.|2
236|Regie|[A woman with her hand on a horse calls out to her children.]|2
238|MORWEN|%othain! %othain! You take your sister. You%ll go faster with just two.|2
240|FREDA|[As Morwen puts her onto the horse in front of her brother] Papa says %othain must not ride Garulf, he is too big for him!|2
242|MORWEN|Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm. Do you understand me?|2
244|%OTHAIN|Yes, Ma!|2
246|FREDA|[starts to cry] I don%t wanna leave! I don't wanna go, Mama!|2
248|MORWEN|Freda, I will find you there.|2
250|Regie|[A woman screams]|2
252|MORWEN|Quickly!|2
254|Regie|[The children ride off.]|2
256|MORWEN|[Looks after them] Go child!|2
258|Regie|[Dunlanders and Uruk-hai enter the village, burning everything in sights as the Rohirrim scream and run in all directions. %othain and Freda weep as they look back from a distance.]|2
260|SARUMAN (V.O.)|Rohan, my lord, is ready to fall.|2
262|Regie|[A group of horsemen ride to Edoras. %omer is in the lead, carrying a gravely wounded Th%odred.]|2
264|Regie|[%owyn runs hastily up the stairs to the Golden Hall and enters a bedchamber. She runs to the bed.]|2
266|%OWYN|Th%odred!|2
268|Regie|[Th%odred seems to hear her call but is unable to respond. He has a bloody gash on the side of his head. %omer nods to %owyn in the direction of Th%odred%s torso. %owyn draws back the covers and upon seeing Th%odred%s fatal wound, her lips tighten and eyes close. She looks up to catch %omer%s eye.]|2
270|Regie|[%omer and %owyn are speaking to Th%oden-king who sits motionless on his throne, wizened, and aged beyond his years.]|2
272|%OWYN|Your son is badly wounded, my lord.|2
276|GR%MA|That is a lie! [Appears from the shadows.] Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.|2
278|TH%ODEN|[mumbles feebly] Gr%ma% Gr%ma% [Gr%ma leans down close to the King.]My son...? Gr%ma...?|2
280|%OMER|Orcs are roaming freely across our lands. Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at will. Orcs bearing the white hand of Saruman. [He drops a helmet onto the ground, which topples over to reveal the white hand of Saruman.]|2
282|GR%MA|Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind. Can you not see? Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent, your war-mongering.|2
284|%OMER|War-mongering?|2
286|Regie|[%omer grabs Gr%ma and pins him against a pillar.]|2
288|%OMER|How long is it since Saruman bought you? What was the promised price, Gr%ma? When all the men are dead you will take your share of the treasure?|2
290|Regie|[Gr%ma%s eyes flicks to right, watching %owyn as she walks by. %owyn stops to stare back for a moment before departing form the hall. %omer jerks Gr%ma again and clutches his hand around Gr%ma%s jaw.]|2
292|%OMER|Too long have you watched my sister, too long have you haunted her steps.|2
294|Regie|[Gr%ma's eyes look to the left and relax as %omer is suddenly pulled off Gr%ma by his thugs.]|2
296|GR%MA|You see much %omer, Son of %omund. Too much. [The thugs punch %omer n the stomach] You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan. Under pain of death!|2
300|Sprechertext||2
302|Regie|[Uruk-hai and Orcs continue to march across the plains with their hobbit captives, with Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli hot on their pursuits.]|2
304|GIMLI|Keep breathing! That%s the key! Breathe! Ho!|2
306|LEGOLAS|They%ve run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.|2
308|Regie|[They continue running over vast distances. The Uruk-hai and Orcs halt at nightfall, many panting with exertion.]|2
310|MORDOR ORC|We%re not going no further till we%ve had a breather!|2
312|UGL%K|Get a fire going!|2
314|Regie|[As the Orcs and Uruk-hai take their rest, Pippin crawls over towards Merry.]|2
316|PIPPIN|Merry! Merry!|2
318|MERRY|[opens his eyes] I think... we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.|2
320|Regie|[A group of Orcs chops down the trees nearby for firewood. Low groans and rumbles start to emerge from the forest.]|2
322|PIPPIN|What%s making that noise?|2
324|MERRY|[looks towards the forest] It%s the trees.|2
326|PIPPIN|What?|2
328|MERRY|Do you remember the Old Forest? On the borders of Buckland? Folk used to say that there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall... and come alive.|2
330|PIPPIN|Alive?|2
332|MERRY|Trees that could whisper. Talk to each other. Even move.|2
334|MA%HUR|I'm starving. We ain't 'ad nothin' but maggoty bread for three stinkin' days!|2
336|SNAGA|Yeah. Why can%t we have some meat? [His eyes rest on the hobbits.] What about them? They%re fresh.|2
338|UGL%K|They are not for eating!|2
340|GRISHN%KH|What about their legs? They don't need those. Ooh% They look tasty!|2
342|UGL%K|[Shoves at the Orcs] Get back, scum!|2
344|Regie|[The other Orcs are getting restless.]|2
346|MORDOR ORC|Carve them up!|2
348|SNAGA|[Moves towards the hobbits with his blade drawn] Just a mouth full.|2
350|UGL%K|No!|2
352|Regie|[Pippin and Merry recoil in fright. Ugl%k jumps on the Orc and cuts off his head, which bounces off the hobbit's shoulders.]|2
354|UGL%K|Looks like meat%s back on the menu, boys!!|2
356|Regie|[The Uruk-hai and Orcs cheer and started tearing into the fresh meat, intestines flying, taking their eyes off the hobbits for a while.]|2
358|MERRY|Pippin, let%s go.|2
360|Regie|[Their hands still bound, the hobbits try to crawl away. Suddenly a foot comes down on Merry and Pippin is turned onto his back.]|2
362|GRISHN%KH|[Brandishing a blade in front of Pippin%s face] Go on, call for help. Squeal! No one%s gonna save you now!|2
364|Regie|[Suddenly, a spear pierces the Orc's back. Mayhem ensues as Riders of Rohan burst out from their hiding places and ambush the Orcs.]|2
366|MERRY|Pippin! [Gestures for them to make their escape.]|2
368|Regie|[The hobbits try to escape from the pandemonium to the forest, dodging bodies and stomping feet. Suddenly Pippin turns onto his face and looks up to a pair of thrashing hooves bearing down on him.]|2
370|PIPPIN|ARGH!!!|2
372|Sprechertext||2
374|Regie|[The Three Hunters are still chasing after the Uruk-hai. It is dawn.]|2
376|LEGOLAS|[Pauses and looks up] A red sun rises. Blood has been spilled this night.|2
378|Regie|[Camera pans over the rock and plains, alternating between the band of Uruk-hai and the Three Hunters giving chase. The trackers hear the sound of horses. Aragorn and company hide behind some boulders. A large group of horse-men appears, galloping quickly with their banners flying. Aragorn comes out of hiding as they pass, followed by Legolas and Gimli.]|2
380|ARAGORN|Riders of Rohan, what news from the Mark?|2
382|Regie|[At a signal from %omer at the lead, the riders make a quick turn and head towards them, surrounding them in ever-tightening circles. As they stop, they point their long spears menacingly at them.]|2
384|%OMER|What business does an Elf, a man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speak quickly!|2
386|GIMLI|Give me your name, Horsemaster, and I shall give you mine.|2
388|Regie|[%omer hands his staff to another rider, and gets off his horse. Aragorn puts a hand on Gimli%s shoulder.]|2
390|%OMER|I would cut off your head, Dwarf, if it stood but a little higher from the ground.|2
392|Regie|[Legolas, in a lightning fast move, points an arrow at %omer.]|2
394|LEGOLAS|You would die before your stroke fell!|2
396|Regie|[The riders all point their spears closer at the travellers. After a tense moment, Aragorn pushes down Legolas% arm.]|2
398|ARAGORN|I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This is Gimli, son of Gl%in and Legolas of the Woodland realm. We are friends of Rohan and of Th%oden, your king.|2
400|%OMER|Th%oden no longer recognizes friend from foe. [Takes off helmet] Not even his own kin.|2
402|Regie|[The spears are withdrawn.]|2
404|%OMER|Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands. My company are those loyal to Rohan. And for that, we are banished. The White Wizard is cunning. He walks here and there, they say, as an old man, hooded and cloaked. And everywhere his spies slip past our nets.|2
406|ARAGORN|We are not spies. We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain. They%ve taken two of our friends captive.|2
410|GIMLI|But there were two hobbits. Did you see two hobbits with them?|2
412|ARAGORN|They would be small % only children to your eyes.|2
414|%OMER|We left none alive. We piled the carcasses and burned them. [Points to a smoking pile in the distance.]|2
416|GIMLI|Dead?|2
418|%OMER|[nods] I am sorry.|2
420|Regie|[Legolas puts a hand on Gimli%s shoulder in grief. %omer turns and whistles.]|2
424|Regie|[%omer puts on his helmet and gets back on his horse]|2
426|%OMER|Look for your friends. But do not trust to hope, it has forsaken these lands. [To the riders] We ride north!|2
428|Regie|[Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli look on as the Riders go off. They then ride towards the burning carcasses. Gimli starts to shift through the smoldering pile, and pulls out a charred belt and dagger sheath.]|2
430|GIMLI|It%s one of their wee belts.|2
432|LEGOLAS|[with his head bowed and eyes closed] Hiro %th% ab 'wanath... (May they find peace in death)|2
434|ARAGORN|[Kicks a helmet and yells] AAARRGGHH!!! [He falls to his knees.]|2
436|GIMLI|We failed them.|2
438|Regie|[Aragorn looks to the side as some tracks catch his attention.]|2
440|ARAGORN|A hobbit lay here, and the other. [Flashback: Pippin yells as he looks up at a pair of thrashing hooves bearing down on him. He rolls over, avoiding the hooves.] They crawled.|2
442|Regie|[ARAGORN STARTS TO FOLLOW THE TRACKS, WITH LEGOLAS AND GIMLI BEHIND HIM. FLASHBACK Merry and Pippin crawl frantically away from the battle.]|2
444|ARAGORN|Their hands were bound. [Flashback: Merry rubs his bonds furiously against the sharp edge of a weapon.] Their bonds were cut. [Aragorn holds up a broken length of thick rope.]|2
446|ARAGORN|They ran over here. They were followed.|2
448|Regie|[FLASHBACK Their hands freed, the hobbits run away from the battle scene, dodging under a horse and trying to stay out of harms way. As they flee, Grishn%kh grabs Pippin by his belt and clings on.]|2
450|MERRY|The belt!|2
452|Regie|[Pippin undoes his belt and Grishn%kh is left holding it.]|2
454|MERRY|Run!|2
456|ARAGORN|The tracks lead away from the battle... [They break into a run and then stop] into Fangorn Forest.|2
458|Regie|[The Three looks up into a dense and dark forest]|2
460|GIMLI|Fangorn. What madness drove them in there?|2
462|Sprechertext||2
464|Regie|[Scene moves from the trackers into the nighttime chase of Merry and Pippin. The hobbits run into the Fangorn, seeking to lose the pursuing Orc. They collapse onto the ground, out of breath.]|2
466|PIPPIN|Did we lose him? [Looks around] I think we lost him.|2
468|Regie|[Suddenly, Grishn%kh appears from behind the trees, brandishing a blade.]|2
470|GRISHN%KH|I%m gonna rip out your filthy little innards! Come here!|2
472|Regie|[Merry and Pippin run and hide behind a tree.]|2
474|MERRY|Trees! Climb a tree!|2
476|Regie|[Pippin and Merry quickly scramble up a tree each.]|2
478|MERRY|[Looks around and then sighs in relief.] He's gone.|2
480|Regie|[Suddenly, Merry is pulled by his legs and falls to the ground. Grishn%kh leans over him with his menacing blade. Merry tries to kick him off but to no avail.]|2
482|PIPPIN|Merry!|2
484|Regie|[Pippin looks down in horror but as he turns his head, he spots a pair of gleaming yellow eyes blinking in the tree he%s clinging to. The tree starts to move and groan.]|2
486|TREEBEARD|Hooooo...|2
488|PIPPIN|Argh!!|2
490|Regie|[Pippin loses his grip in fright and grabs at the air futilely as he falls. The tree catches him before he hits the ground.]|2
492|GRISHN%KH|Let%s put a maggot-hole in your belly. [Suddenly he senses something behind him and as he looks up, the tree stomps and squashes him onto the forest floor.]|2
494|PIPPIN|Run, Merry!|2

502|TREEBEARD|Tree?! I am no tree. I am an Ent. [Stomps slowly through the forest.]|2
504|MERRY|A treeherder! A shepherd of the forest.|2
506|PIPPIN|Don%t talk to it, Merry. Don%t encourage it.|2
508|TREEBEARD|Treebeard, some call me.|2
510|PIPPIN|And whose side are you on?|2
512|TREEBEARD|Side? I am on nobody%s side because nobody%s on my side, little Orc. Nobody cares for the woods anymore.|2
514|MERRY|We%re not Orcs. We%re Hobbits!|2
516|TREEBEARD|Hobbits? Never heard of a hobbit before. Sounds like Orc mischief to me! [Tightens his hold on the hobbits and squeezes them. Merry and Pippin whimpers in pain] They come with fire, they come with axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning! Destroyers and usurpers, curse them!|2
518|MERRY|No, you don%t understand. We%re Hobbits... Halflings! Shirefolk!|2
520|TREEBEARD|Maybe you are and maybe you aren%t. The White Wizard will know.|2

530|Regie|[Following Gollum, Frodo and Sam reach the end of Emyn Muil and see that Mordor is now closer.]|2
532|GOLLUM|See, see, we have led you out! Hurry hobbitses hurry. Very lucky we find you.|2
534|Regie|[Gollum jumps on a rock. Frodo walks past, Gollum shrinks as Sam draws near.]|2
536|GOLLUM|Nice hobbit. [Leaps after Frodo, putting a wide berth between him and Sam.]|2
538|Regie|[Sam%s foot slipped into muck.]|2
540|SAM|Whoa, it%s a bog! He%s led us into a swamp!|2
542|GOLLUM|A swamp, yes, yes. Come, master. We will take you on safe paths through the mist. Come, hobbits, come. We go quickly.|2
544|Regie|[Gollum looks back and gestures for the hobbits to follow.]|2
546|GOLLUM|I found it, I did. The way through the marshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it. They go round for miles and miles. Come quickly. Swift and quick as shadows we must be.|2
548|Regie|[The marsh lands stretch for miles and miles as far as the eye can see. The hobbits and Gollum appear as little specks. As the three pick their way gingerly though the marshes, they see faces floating in the water, still, rotting and pale, and flickering flames on the swamps.]|2
550|SAM|There are dead things! Dead faces in the water!|2
552|GOLLUM|All dead. All rotten. Elves and men and orcses. A great battle long ago. [Turns to face the hobbits.] The Dead Marshes. Yes, yes that is their name. This way. Don%t follow the lights.|2
554|Regie|[Sam%s foot slips again into the water.]|2
556|SAM|Ohh!|2
558|GOLLUM|Careful now, or hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.|2
560|Regie|[Frodo is drawn to one of the faces in Elven armour. He stares at it intently, until suddenly its eyes open and Frodo falls face-down into the water.]|2
562|SAM|Frodo!|2
564|Regie|[Frodo is in the water and sees many faces of the dead, no longer still but screaming and grasping, their rotten robes and hair flowing about their gruesome faces. Their hands are reaching for him. Suddenly he is grabbed from behind. Frodo sputters and gasps for air as Gollum pulls him out of the water.]|2
566|FRODO|[Looks at Gollum in perplexed gratitude and disbelief.] Gollum...|2
568|GOLLUM|Don%t follow the lights! [Crawls away]|2
570|SAM|[Runs to Frodo%s side.] Mr. Frodo! Are you alright?|2
572|Regie|[Frodo lies panting, staring after Gollum]|2

576|Regie|[NIGHTFALL Sam is asleep but Frodo is still awake. He is holding the Ring in the palm of his hand and stroking it, mesmerized. Suddenly he hears Gollum.]|2
578|GOLLUM|Sooo bright. Sooo beautiful. [Frodo quickly puts the Ring back inside his shirt. He looks up to see Gollum crouching away from him, stroking the centre of his palm] our preciousss...|2
580|FRODO|What did you say?|2
582|GOLLUM|Master should be resting. Master needs to keep up his strength.|2
584|FRODO|[Moves over and crouches in front of Gollum] Who are you?|2
586|GOLLUM|Mustn%t ask us. Not its business. *Gollum, Gollum*|2
588|FRODO|Gandalf told me you were one of the River Folk.|2
590|GOLLUM|Cold be heart and hand and bone. Cold be travellers far from home.|2
592|FRODO|He said your life was a sad story.|2
594|GOLLUM|They do not see what lies ahead, when sun has failed and moon is dead.|2
596|FRODO|You were not so very different from a hobbit once, were you... Sm%agol?|2
598|GOLLUM|[Looks up slowly.] What did you call me?|2
600|FRODO|That was your name once, wasn%t it? A long time ago.|2
602|GOLLUM|My name... My name... S... S...Sm%agol%|2
604|Regie|[Suddenly, the piercing cries of the Nazg%l are heard overhead]|2
606|GOLLUM|Argh!!|2
608|SAM|Black Riders!|2
610|GOLLUM|Hide! Hide!|2
612|FRODO|Argh!|2
614|Regie|[Suddenly Frodo feels the pain of the Nazg%l's sword piercing him and the call of the Ring. Images of the Ringwraiths come to him in flashes.]|2
616|FRODO|Argh!!|2
618|SAM|C%mon Frodo! C'mon!|2
620|Regie|[Frodo continues to clutch at the Ring on his chest, immobilized. Sam drags Frodo across to hide beneath some bramble bushes. The Nazg%l appears, tightening his hold on the reins. Camera then shows him riding a Fell Beast, swooping down across the marsh lands. Chilling screams of the Nazg%l fill the air.]|2
622|GOLLUM|Quick! They will see us! They will see us!|2
624|SAM|I thought they were dead!|2
626|GOLLUM|Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No.|2
628|Regie|[A loud screech from the Nazg%l flying high above the marshes.]|2
630|GOLLUM|[cowering] Wraiths! Wraiths on wings! They are calling for it. They are calling for the preciousss.|2
632|Regie|[Frodo feels the call of the Ring and gropes for his necklace. Sam sees this and grabs hold of Frodo%s hand.]|2
634|SAM|Mr. Frodo! It%s alright. I%m here.|2

642|Regie|[Scene returns to Fangorn forest. Gimli fingers a dark stain on a leaf and brings it to his mouth.]|2

646|ARAGORN|These are strange tracks.|2
648|GIMLI|The air is so close in here.|2
650|LEGOLAS|This forest is old. Very old. Full of memory... and anger.|2
652|Regie|[Groans reverberate through the forest and Gimli raises his axe.]|2
654|LEGOLAS|The trees are speaking to each other.|2
656|ARAGORN|[Whispers] Gimli!|2
658|GIMLI|Huh?|2
660|ARAGORN|[Gestures] Lower your axe.|2
662|GIMLI|[Lowering his axe slowly] Oh.|2

668|Regie|[Close-up of Legolas% eyes]|2

672|ARAGORN|Do not let him speak. He will put a spell on us.|2
674|Regie|[Aragorn wraps his hand around the hilt of his sword, Gimli tightens his hold on his axes, and Legolas notches an arrow to his bow.]|2
676|ARAGORN|We must be quick.|2
678|Regie|[With a yell, the three swing round to attack. Gimli%s axe and Legolas% arrow are deflected. Aragorn drops his sword as it becomes red hot in his grasp. They shield their eyes with their hands from the bright light emanating from the White Wizard.]|2
680|WHITE WIZARD|You are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits.|2
682|ARAGORN|Where are they?|2
684|WHITE WIZARD|They passed this way the day before yesterday. They met someone they did not expect. Does that comfort you?|2
686|ARAGORN|Who are you? Show yourself!|2
688|Regie|[The bright light dims, revealing Gandalf, all dressed in white. The three are astounded. Legolas and Gimli bow.]|2
690|ARAGORN|It cannot be. You fell.|2
692|GANDALF|Through fire and water. [Flashback: Gandalf is battling the Balrog atop D%rin%s Tower.] From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak, I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.|2
694|Regie|[Gandalf holds up Glamdring and a flash of lightning strikes it before he plunges the sword into the Balrog. With a final cry, the Balrog falls from the peak and lands, smoking, onto the icy mountainside.]|2
696|GANDALF|Until at last, I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.|2
698|Regie|[On top of the mountain, Gandalf crawls a bit and then collapses.]|2
700|GANDALF|Darkness took me. And I strayed out of thought and time. [Camera zooms in Gandalf%s eye and enters an amorphous realm of stars and galaxies, ending in a blinding white light] Stars wheeled overhead and everyday was as long as a life-age of the earth. But it was not the end. I felt life in me again.|2
702|Regie|[Camera zooms out from Gandalf%s eye, lying naked and very still. His hair has turned white and wounds are completely healed. He suddenly shudders with a deep gasp and pants as life returns to him]|2
704|GANDALF|I've been sent back until my task is done.|2
706|ARAGORN|Gandalf!|2
708|GANDALF|Gandalf? Yes... That's what they used to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was my name. [He smiles]|2
710|GIMLI|Gandalf!|2
712|GANDALF|[With a twinkle in his eye] I am Gandalf the White. [Aragorn grins] And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.|2
714|Regie|[They walk through the forest, with Gandalf leading the way, now wearing a grey cloak over his white robes.]|2
716|GANDALF|One stage of your journey is over, another begins. War has come to Rohan. We must ride to Edoras with all speed.|2
718|Regie|[Outside the forest, Gandalf whistles piercingly. Soon an answering neigh is heard and a white horse appears from the plain, answering the call.]|2
720|LEGOLAS|That is one of the Mearas, unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.|2
722|Regie|[The horse comes round to stop in front of Gandalf.]|2
724|GANDALF|Shadowfax. [Gimli bows in the background.] He's the lord of all horses and he's been my friend through many dangers.|2

730|Regie|[Back at Fangorn, Treebeard is walking through the forest with Merry and Pippin sitting on his shoulders.]|2
732|TREEBEARD|My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain. I told Gandalf I would keep you safe and safe is where I%ll keep you. The trees have grown wild and dangerous. Anger festers in their hearts. They will harm you if they can. There are too few of us now. Too few of us Ents left to manage them.|2

740|Regie|[The enormous Black Gate comes into view with Orcs patrolling and standing guard on the towers and atop the walls. From the right, an army of Easterling soldiers is marching to the Black Gate.]|2
742|SAM|Oh save us. My ol' Gaffer'd have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.|2
744|GOLLUM|Master says to show him the way into Mordor, so good Sm%agol does. Master says so.|2
746|FRODO|I did.|2
748|Regie|[Orcs are patrolling the Black Gate.]|2
750|SAM|That%s it then. We cannot get past that.|2
752|Regie|[A command is heard and an Orc sounds a horn, signalling for the Gate to be opened. Two enormous cave trolls stretch and growl and then pull the mighty Gate open.]|2
754|SAM|Look! The gate, it's opening! I can see a way down.|2
756|Regie|[He moves closer to the edge. Suddenly, the rock underneath him gives way and he falls.]|2
758|FRODO|Sam, no!|2
760|SAM|Argh!!|2
762|Regie|[Frodo goes after Sam.]|2
764|GOLLUM|Master!|2
766|Regie|[Two Easterling soldiers see streams of dust coming down the cliff made by Sam and Frodo. They move away from the troop to investigate. Frodo reaches Sam who is stuck in the scree. As the Easterlings move closer and closer, Frodo throws his Elvish cloak over himself and Sam. The soldiers are now directly in front of Sam, but their eyes see nothing but rock. Frodo and Sam peer from underneath the cloak. The soldiers soon leave and after a moment, Frodo throws back the cloak and pulls Sam out.]|2
768|FRODO|I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.|2
770|SAM|I know, Mr Frodo. I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.|2
772|Regie|[They prepare to make a run for the Gate.]|2
774|FRODO|Now!|2
776|Regie|[Gollum pulls them back.]|2
778|GOLLUM|No! No, no master! They catch you! They catch you! Don%t take it to him! He wants the preciousss. Always he%s looking for it! And the preciousss is wanting to go back to him. But we mustn%t let him have it.|2
780|Regie|[Frodo tries to make a run for it.]|2
782|GOLLUM|No! [Pulls Frodo back again.] There%s another way. More secret. A dark way.|2
784|SAM|Why haven%t you spoken of this before?!|2
786|GOLLUM|Because Master did not ask!|2
788|SAM|He%s up to something.|2
790|FRODO|Are you saying there%s another way into Mordor?|2
792|GOLLUM|Yes. There is a path, and some stairs, and then% a tunnel. [Frodo and Sam watch as the Black Gate closes. Gollum is stroking Frodo%s arm and burying his face in his cloak.]|2
794|FRODO|He%s led us this far, Sam.|2
796|SAM|Mr. Frodo, no.|2
798|FRODO|He%s been true to his word.|2
800|SAM|[Whispers] No!|2
802|FRODO|Lead the way, Sm%agol.|2
804|GOLLUM|Good Sm%agol always helps.|2

808|Regie|[On the plains of Rohan. Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli stop as Edoras comes into view.]|2
810|GANDALF|Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. There dwells Th%oden, King of Rohan, whose mind is overthrown. Saruman%s hold over King Th%oden is now very strong.|2
812|Regie|[In the Hall, %owyn is kneeling before Th%oden, holding his hand in hers.]|2
816|Regie|[Th%oden just sits and stares ahead, his eyes clouded and unseeing.]|2
818|%OWYN|Will you not go to him? [She weeps.] Will you do nothing?|2
820|Regie|[Scene returns to Gandalf and company.]|2
822|GANDALF|Be careful what you say. Do not look for welcome here.|2
824|Regie|[They ride on towards Edoras.]|2
826|Sprechertext||2
828|Regie|[At Edoras, %owyn is weeping at the dead Th%odred's bed. She kisses his hand. Gr%ma appears at the door.]|2
830|GR%MA|Oh, he% he must have died sometime in the night. What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.|2
832|Regie|[He sits on the bed and puts a hand on %owyn%s shoulder.]|2
834|GR%MA|I understand his passing is hard to accept, especially now that your brother has deserted you.|2
836|%OWYN|[jumps back and throws off Gr%ma%s hand] Leave me alone, snake!|2
838|GR%MA|[Rises from the bed and moves ever closer to %owyn] Oh, but you are alone! Who knows what you have spoken to the darkness. In bitter watches of the night, when all your life seems to shrink, the walls of your bower closing in about you, like a hutch to trammel some wild thing in.|2
840|Regie|[He puts a hand on her cheek and moves down to her throat.]|2
842|GR%MA|So fair, so cold, like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.|2
844|Regie|[%owyn and Gr%ma stare at each other intently.]|2
846|%OWYN|Your words are poison!|2
848|Regie|[%owyn runs out of the hall. Weeping, she looks away into the distance. A flag comes off its pole and is carried by the breeze. %owyn sees riders coming towards Edoras. As Aragorn passes the entrance to Edoras, the flag floats down to land near him. Edoras is silent and somber. Everyone is dressed in black and staring at the newcomers in wary silence. Aragorn looks up at the hall and sees a lady in white standing on the steps. He looks around at more somber people.]|2
850|GIMLI|You%ll find more cheer in a graveyard.|2
852|Regie|[Aragorn looks up to the hall again but the lady has disappeared. The company climbs up the stairs to the hall and is met by guards.]|2
854|GANDALF|[sees H%ma] Ah.|2
856|H%MA|I cannot allow you before Th%oden-King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order of Gr%ma Wormtongue.|2
858|Regie|[Gandalf nods in understanding and signals for the others to surrender their weapons. Aragon hands over his sword and knives. Legolas gives a little twirl to his knives before handing them over to the guards. Gimli hands over his axes reluctantly.]|2
860|H%MA|[gestures to Gandalf] Your staff.|2
862|GANDALF|Hmm? [Glances at his staff.] Oh. You would not part an old man from his walking stick? [Looks at H%ma innocently.]|2
864|Regie|[H%ma hesitates for a second and then gestures that they follow him into the hall. Gandalf gives Aragorn a tiny wink and enters the hall, leaning on Legolas% arm.]|2
866|GR%MA|[Leaning down and whispering to Th%oden.] My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming. He%s a herald of woe.|2
868|GANDALF|The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, Th%oden King.|2
870|Regie|[As Gandalf approaches Th%oden, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli pull back and survey the hall and its hostile occupants. A group of men starts to follow their steps with hostility.]|2
872|GR%MA|[Whispering to Th%oden.] He%s not welcome.|2
874|TH%ODEN|Why should I% welcome you, Gandalf% Stormcrow? [Looks to Gr%ma for affirmation.]|2
876|GR%MA|A just question, my liege. [He walks towards Gandalf.] Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear. Lathspell spell I name him. Ill news is an ill guest.|2
878|GANDALF|Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind you teeth. I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm! [Raises his staff against Gr%ma.]|2
880|GR%MA|His staff! [Backing away from Gandalf while addressing the guards] I told you to take the wizard%s staff!|2
882|Regie|[The hostile guards attack. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli engage them in a fist-fight as Gandalf continues to approach Th%oden. Gamling tries to go forward but H%ma holds him back.]|2
884|GANDALF|Th%oden, son of Thengel, too long have you sat in the shadows.|2
886|Regie|[Gr%ma tries to crawl away unnoticed, but Gimli catches him and pins him to the floor.]|2
888|GIMLI|[Growls] I would stay still, if I were you.|2
890|GANDALF|Hearken to me! I release you from the spell. [Gestures with his hand]|2
892|TH%ODEN|[Menacingly] Hahahhhahahahah! [Gandalf opens his eyes in surprise.] You have no power here, Gandalf the Grey!|2
894|Regie|[Gandalf throws back his grey cloak, exuding blinding white light. Th%oden is thrown back against his seat.]|2
896|TH%ODEN|Argh!|2
898|GANDALF|[Points his staff towards Th%oden.] I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.|2
900|Regie|[%owyn rushes in. Seeing her uncle threatened, she tries to go to him but is held back by Aragorn.]|2
902|ARAGORN|Wait.|2
904|TH%ODEN|[In Saruman%s voice.] If I go. . . Th%oden dies.|2
906|Regie|[Gandalf moves his staff sharply and Th%oden flies back against the chair again.]|2
908|GANDALF|You did not kill me, you will not kill him!|2
910|TH%ODEN|[in Saruman's voice] Rohan is mine!|2
912|GANDALF|Be gone!!|2
914|Regie|[Gandalf smites Th%oden as he lunges at him. Th%oden is thrown back into the chair and the shot changes to Saruman flying backwards from the Palant%r which he used to manipulate Th%oden. He lands landing hard on the floor of Orthanc, bleeding from a gash in his forehead. In the hall, Th%oden lets out a moan and slumps forward in the chair. %owyn runs to her uncle%s side as he falls. Th%oden%s head rises again and his face begins to change gradually into that of a much younger-looking man. Clarity and recognition returns to his eyes.]|2
916|TH%ODEN|[Looks closely at %owyn] I know your face. %owyn% %owyn.|2
918|Regie|[%owyn weeps with joy]|2
920|TH%ODEN|Gandalf?|2
922|GANDALF|Breathe the free air again, my friend.|2
924|Regie|[The hall is shown to be filled with light again, as everyone marvels at the rejuvenation of the king.]|2
926|TH%ODEN|[Standing up and looking around him.] Dark have been my dreams of late. [He looks down at his trembling hands.]|2
928|GANDALF|Your fingers would remember their old strength better... if they grasped your sword.|2
930|Regie|[H%ma runs up with his sword. Th%oden reaches for it with trembling hands. He wraps his fingers around it slowly and then draws it, gazing upon the shiny steel. In a corner, Gr%ma trembles and tries to escape but is pulled back by Gimli. Suddenly, Th%oden%s gaze turns to Gr%ma. Gr%ma is thrown out of the hall and down the stairs.]|2
932|GR%MA|Argh! [Beseechingly to Th%oden] I've only ever served you, my lord!|2
934|TH%ODEN|[Advancing towards Gr%ma, holding the sword firmly in his hand] Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!|2
936|GR%MA|[Grovelling] Send me not from your side.|2
938|Regie|[Th%oden raises his sword to kill Gr%ma. Aragorn holds him back.]|2
940|ARAGORN|No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go. Enough blood has been spilled on his account.|2
942|Regie|[Gr%ma scrambles to his feet and pushes through the crowd]|2
944|GR%MA|Get out of my way!|2
946|H%MA|Hail, Th%oden king!|2
948|Regie|[The crowd kneels in homage before Th%oden. Aragorn kneels also. Gr%ma rides out of Edoras. As Th%oden turns to go back into the hall, he looks up.]|2
950|TH%ODEN|Where is Th%odred? Where is my son?|2
952|Sprechertext|                         |2
954|Regie|[A white flower comes into view, held up by a hand. It is released and spirals down to land among similar flowers, in front of a tomb.]|2
956|TH%ODEN|Simbelmyn%. Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers. [Looks at Gandalf] Now it shall cover the grave of my son. Alas, that these evil days should be mine. The young perish and the old linger. That I should live to see the last days of my house.|2
958|GANDALF|Th%odred%s death was not of your making.|2
960|TH%ODEN|No parent should have to bury their child.|2
962|Regie|[Th%oden starts to weep]|2
964|GANDALF|He was strong in life. His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers. Westu h%l. Fer%u, Th%odred, Fer%u. (Be-thou well. Go-thou, Th%odred, go-thou.)|2
966|Regie|[Gandalf turns to go back to the hall and leaves Th%oden to grieve in private. He spots two children on horseback. The boy collapses and falls off the horse. Later, inside the Golden Hall, the two children are eating at a table, and %owyn is with them.]|2
968|%OWYN|They had no warning. They were unarmed. Now the wildmen are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go. Rick, cot and tree.|2
970|FREDA|Where%s mama?|2
972|%OWYN|Shh...|2
974|GANDALF|This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash. All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron. Ride out and meet him head on. Draw him away from your women and children. [Leans forward and puts a hand on Th%oden%s chair. Th%oden looks at his hand warily.] You must fight.|2
976|ARAGORN|You have two thousand good men riding north as we speak. %omer is loyal to you. His men will return and fight for their king.|2
978|TH%ODEN|They will be three hundred leagues from here by now. %omer cannot help us. I know what it is that you want of me. But I will not bring further death to my people. I will not risk open war.|2
980|Regie|[Gimli takes a bite of his bread as he watches the exchange between Aragorn and Th%oden.]|2
982|ARAGORN|Open war is upon you. Whether you would risk it or not.|2
984|TH%ODEN|When last I looked, Th%oden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.|2
986|Regie|[Gimli takes a drink and burps.]|2
988|GANDALF|Then what is the king%s decision?|2
990|Regie|[Scene shifts to outside Meduseld]|2
992|H%MA|By order of the king, the city must empty. We make for the refuge of Helm%s Deep. Do not burden yourselves with treasures. Take only what provisions you need.|2
994|Regie|[People are moving about, gathering their belongings and preparing to move. Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli walk towards the stables.]|2

1504|Regie|[Arwen hears him and sits up.]|2
1506|ELROND|Tollen i l%. I chair gwannar na Valannor. Si bado, no c%rar. (Arwen, it is time. The ships are leaving for Valinor. Go now... before it is too late.)|2
1508|ARWEN|I have made my choice.|2
1510|ELROND|He is not coming back. Why do you linger here when there is no hope?|2
1512|ARWEN|There is still hope.|2
1514|ELROND|[Walks towards window and looks out] If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted. If Sauron is defeated, and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true, you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality. Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time, Aragorn will die.|2
1516|Regie|[Arwen sees a vision of her future as Elrond speaks. She is dressed as a queen in mourning garb and looking down upon Aragorn, a crown on his brow, And%ril in his hand, and dead. Mourners are walking around the altar, paying their final respects. Arwen is weeping.]|2
1518|ELROND|And there will be no comfort for you. No comfort to ease the pain of his passing. He will come to death, an image of the splendor of the kings of men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.|2
1520|Regie|[The body of Aragorn is now cast as a monument in stone. Arwen stands before the monument, veiled and in black.]|2
1522|ELROND|But you, my daughter, you will linger on in darkness and in doubt. As nightfall in winter that comes without a star. Here you will dwell, bound to your grief, under the fading trees, until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.|2
1524|Regie|[Still veiled in black, Arwen is walking alone through the deserted woods of Lothl%rien.]|2
1526|ELROND|[Tuning to Arwen] Arwen... there is nothing for you here, only death.|2
1528|Regie|[The vision ends and Arwen weeps with sadness and fear. Elrond comes to sit beside his daughter and raises a hand to her cheek.]|2
1530|ELROND|A im, %-'erin veleth l%n? (Do I not also have your love?)|2
1532|ARWEN|[Crying and moving into her father%s embrace] Gerich meleth n%n, ada. (You have my love, father)|2
1534|Regie|[Elves, cloaked and carrying a lantern each, are setting off from Rivendell on their journey to the West. Elrond looks on as Arwen leaves with them. Arwen turns back to look at her father one last time before she departs. Elrond continues to stare after her with an expression of resigned sadness.]|2

1538|GALADRIEL|I amar prestar aen... han mathon ne nen, han mathon ne chae a han nostan ned gwilith. (The world has changed... I feel it in the water, I feel it in the earth, I smell it in the air.) The power of the enemy is growing. [Saruman is communicating with Sauron via the Palant%r.] Sauron will use his puppet Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan. Isengard has been unleashed. [View of Saruman's marching army] The eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor, the last free kingdom of men. [View of Osgiliath] His war on this country will come swiftly. He senses the Ring is close. The strength of the Ringbearer is failing. In his heart, Frodo begins to understand. [Close-up of Galadriel] The quest will claim his life. You know this. You have foreseen it. It is the risk we all took.|2
1540|Regie|[Close-up of the Ring spinning in slow motion]|2

1544|Regie|[We see Faramir and Gondorian rangers with the captured Frodo and Sam.]|2
1546|GALADRIEL (V.O.)|Men, who are so easily seduced by its power. The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hands, take the Ring for his own and the world will fall. It is close now, so close to achieving its goal.|2

1564|FARAMIR|How many?|2
1566|MADRIL|Some thousands. More come every day.|2
1568|FARAMIR|Who%s covering the river to the north?|2
1570|MADRIL|We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath, but if the city is attacked, we won%t hold it.|2
1572|FARAMIR|[Tracing on the map] Saruman attacks from Isengard. Sauron from Mordor. The fight will come to men on both fronts. Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us soon. And he will strike hard. He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.|2
1574|Regie|[The hobbits are unbound and blindfolds taken off them by Damrod and another ranger. Sam and Frodo find themselves in a cave behind a waterfall, with Damrod sitting behind them on a rock constantly watching them. Faramir comes up to them and sits.].|2
1576|FARAMIR|My men tell me that you are Orc spies.|2
1578|SAM|Spies?! Now wait just a minute!|2
1580|FARAMIR|Well if you%re not spies, then who are you?|2

1596|Regie|[Sam looks shifty-eyed and uncomfortable.]|2
1598|FRODO|We set out from Rivendell with seven companions. One we lost in M%ria. Two were my kin. A Dwarf there was also, and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.|2
1600|FARAMIR|[Intently] You%re a friend of Boromir?|2
1602|FRODO|Yes... for my part.|2
1604|FARAMIR|It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.|2

1636|Regie|[Faramir has his hand raised to order his men to shoot. At the last moment, Frodo calls out.]|2
1638|FRODO|Wait! [Faramir stops] This creature is bound to me. And I to him. He is our guide. Please, let me go down to him.|2
1640|Regie|[Faramir nods. Frodo descends to the Forbidden Pool and approaches Gollum who is gorging on the raw fish.]|2

1660|FARAMIR|Where are you leading them? Answer me!|2
1662|GOLLUM|[Cooing, his hand stroking his shoulder] Sm%a%gol... Why does it cry, Sm%agol?|2

1724|Regie|[He rides into Helm%s Deep to the amazement of all.]|2

1750|ARAGORN|Ten thousand strong at least.|2
1752|TH%ODEN|Ten thousand?!|2

1764|TH%ODEN|We will cover the causeway and the gate from above. No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg.|2
1766|GIMLI|This is no rabble of mindless Orcs. These are Uruk-hai. Their armor is thick and their shields broad.|2
1768|TH%ODEN|I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf. I know how to defend my own keep.|2
1770|Regie|[Gimli seems miffed. Legolas claps a hand on Gimli%s shoulder as he follows Aragorn and Th%oden back in.]|2
1772|TH%ODEN|They will break upon this fortress like water on rock. Saruman%s hordes will pillage and burn, we%ve seen it before. Crops can be resown; homes rebuilt. Within these walls, we will outlast them.|2
1774|ARAGORN|They do not come to destroy Rohan%s crops or villages. They come to destroy its people. Down to the last child.|2
1776|TH%ODEN|[Draws close to Aragorn] What would you have me do? Look at my men. Their courage hangs by a thread. If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.|2
1778|ARAGORN|Send out riders, my lord. You must call for aid.|2
1780|TH%ODEN|And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We are not so lucky in our friends as you. The old alliances are dead.|2
1782|ARAGORN|Gondor will answer.|2
1784|TH%ODEN|Gondor? Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell? Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us? Where was Gon% % No, my lord Aragorn, we are alone. [He walks away, calling out orders] Get the women and children into the caves.|2

Another child wearing oversized chain mail takes up a huge shield. Th%oden stands inside the main hall of the keep, his back to the entrance where a bright white light is streaming through.]|2
1854|TH%ODEN|To whatever end% Where is the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? They have passed like rain on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow. The days have gone down in the west. Behind the hills, into shadow. How did it come to this?|2

1858|Regie|[Everyone is getting ready for war at the battlements. Aragorn is sitting on the steps. He sees a young lad in armour holding a sword looking around nervously.]|2

1878|ARAGORN|%-moe edhored, Legolas. (There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.)|2

The women and children in the caves hear the sounds overhead and are frightened. Mothers draw their children close and try to sooth crying babies.

With a row of Elf archers, Gimli is standing beside Legolas behind a wall, only the top of his helmet visible.]|2

2186|TREEBEARD|South? But that will lead you past Isengard.|2
2188|PIPPIN|Yes. Exactly. If we go south we can slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm. It%s the last thing he%ll expect.|2
2190|TREEBEARD|Mmmm. That doesn%t make sense to me. But then, you are very small. Perhaps you%re right. South it is then. Hold on, little Shirelings. I always like going south. Somehow it feels like going down hill.|2

Feeling the call of the Ring, he holds it up. Faramir watches the unfolding tableau from below. As Frodo moves to put the Ring on his finger and the Nazg%l flies closer and closer, Sam runs up and knocks Frodo over. Faramir releases an arrow and shoots the Fell Beast. Frodo and Sam roll down the stairs. As they come to a stop at the bottom, Frodo holds Sam in a death grip, yells and points Sting at his throat, his eyes livid with madness and anger that someone would try to take the Ring away.]|2

2358|FRODO|[Slowly and with despair] I can%t do this, Sam.|2
2360|SAM|[Getting up slowly] I know. It%s all wrong. By rights we shouldn%t even be here. But we are. [He stands and leans against a wall, looking out into the distance.] It%s like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn%t want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? [Images of the riders winning the battle against the Uruk-hai at Helm%s Deep] How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?|2
2362|TH%ODEN|Victory! We have victory! [He raises his sword with a victorious cry]|2
2364|SAM|But in the end, it%s only a passing thing, this shadow. [The women and children welcome the men as they return. %owyn runs up to Aragorn and embraces him, crying tears of relief.] Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. [Isengard is flooded. Merry and Pippin looks on from their perch on Treebeard. On the balcony, Saruman stumbles back into his chamber] And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn%t. They kept going because they were holding on to something.|2
2366|FRODO|What are we holding on to, Sam?|2
2368|SAM|There%s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it%s worth fighting for.|2
