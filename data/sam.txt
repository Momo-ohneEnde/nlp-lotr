 i think i'll just have another ale. good night. mind who you're sweet-taking. does she? good night, mr. frodo. i haven't been dropping no eaves. honest. i was just cutting the grass under the window there if you follow me. i heard raisedices. nothing important. that is, i heard a good deal about a ring, and a dark lord  and something about the end of the world but  please, mr. gandalf, sir, don't hurt me. don't turn me into anything unnatural. this is it. if i take one more step  it'll be the farthest away from home i've ever been. they're leaving middle-earth. i don't know why  it makes me sad. everywhere i lie there's a dirty great root sticking into my back. it's not working, mr. frodo. i'm never going to be able to sleep out here. mr. frodo? frodo? frodo! i thought i'd lost you. it's just something gandalf said. “don't you lose him, samwise gamgee.” and i don't mean to. get off him. come on, frodo. you've been into farmer maggot's crop! trust a brandybuck and a took! short cut to what? be quiet! anything? get down! frodo! frodo, come on! come on! faster! what do we do now? you got a whole half already! that fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we arrived. let him go! or i'll have you, longshanks. but where is he leading us? did you hear that? rivendell. we're going to see the elves. we saved some for you, mr. frodo. back, you devils! frodo! strider! help him, strider. we're six days from rivendell! he'll never make it! look, frodo. it's mr. bilbo's trolls. mr. frodo? he's going cold. athelas? kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed. she's an elf. what are you doing?! those wraiths are still out there! frodo! bless you, you're awake! we were that worried about you. weren't we, mr. gandalf? now, what have i forgotten? no harm in being prepared. i do. i did. it's just  we did what gandalf wanted, didn't we? we got the ring this far, to rivendell. and i thought  seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be off soon. off home. mr. frodo's not going anywhere without me. what is that? bye-bye, bill. strider! get off him! now there's an eye opener, and no mistake. frodo! i think i'm getting the hang of this. frodo! he's alive. mr. frodo? i bet they don't mention his fireworks. there should be a verse about them. the finest rockets ever seen they burst in stars of blue and green or after thunder, silver showers came falling like a rain of flowers oh, that doesn't do them justice by a long road. thank you, my lady. have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers? have some food, mr. frodo. you haven't eaten anything all day. you're not sleeping, neither. don't think i haven't noticed. mr. frodo but you're not. i'm here to help you. i promised gandalf that i would. mr. frodo! frodo! frodo, no! frodo! mr. frodo! of course you are. and i'm coming with you! i made a promise, mr. frodo. a promise: “don't you leave him, samwise gamgee.” and i don't mean to. i don't mean to. strider will look after them. we may yet, mr. frodo. we may.  what is it, mr. frodo? can you see the bottom? catch it! grab it, mr. frodo! mr. frodo! bogs and rope, and goodness knows what. it's not natural. none of it. nothing. just a bit of seasoning. i thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something. you never know. it's very special, that. it's the best salt in all the shire. who's gonna follow us down here, mr. frodo? it's a shame, really. lady galadriel gave me that. real elvish rope. well, there's nothing for it. it's one of my knots. won't come free in a hurry. mordor. the one place in middle-earth we don't want to see any closer. and it's the one place we're trying to get to. it's just where we can't get. let's face it, mr. frodo, we're lost. i don't think gandalf meant for us to come this way. mr. frodo? it's the ring, isn't it? well, let me see. oh, yes. lovely. lembas bread. and look! more lembas bread. i don't usually hold with foreign food  but this elvish stuff, it's not bad. those rain clouds might. this looks strangely familiar. what is that horrid stink? i warrant there's a nasty bog nearby. can you smell it? quiet, you! it's hopeless. every orc in mordor's going to hear this racket. let's just tie him up and leave him. it's no more than you deserve! i don't believe you! get down! i said, down! he's trying to trick us. if we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep. hey! come back now! come back! there! what did i tell you? he's run off, the old villain. so much for his promises. it's a bog. he's led us into a swamp. i hate this place. it's too quiet. there's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days. well, starve, then. and good riddance! there are dead things! dead faces in the water. frodo! mr. frodo! are you all right? black riders! come on, frodo. come on! i thought they were dead. mr. frodo! it's all right. i'm here. oh, save us. my old gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now. that's it, then. we can't get past that. look! the gate. it's opening! i can see a way down. i know, mr. frodo. i doubt even these elvish cloaks will hide us in there. why haven't you spoken of this before? he's up to something. mr. frodo, no. no. hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead. what? because. because that's what he is, mr. frodo. there's naught left in him but lies and deceit. it's the ring he wants. it's all he cares about. why? you can't save him, mr. frodo. i do. it's the ring. you can't take your eyes off it. i've seen you. you're not eating. you barely sleep. it's taken hold of you, mr. frodo. you have to fight it. can't you hear yourself? don't you know who you sound like? you'll make him sick, you will  behaving like that. there's only one way to eat a brace of coneys. what's to ruin? there's hardly any meat on 'em. waht we need's a few good taters. po-ta-toes. boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew. lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish. even you couldn't say no to that. you're hopeless. mr. frodo? who are they? ready to do what? mr. frodo. look. it's an oliphaunt. no one at home will believe this. wait! we're innocent travelers! spies? now wait just a minute. his gardener. we have to get out of here. you go. go, now. you can do it. use the ring, mr. frodo. just this once. put it on. disappear. mr. frodo  stop it! leave him alone. don't you understand? he's got to destroy it! that's where we're going, into mordor. to the mountain of fire! please. it's such a burden. will you not help him? mr. frodo? hold on, mr. frodo. you'll be all right. do you want to know what happened to boromir? you want to know why your brother died? he tried to take the ring from frodo after swearing an oath to protect him! he tried to kill him! the ring drove your brother mad! mr. frodo? what are you doing? where are you going? it's me. it's your sam. don't you know your sam? i know. it's all wrong. by rights, we shouldn't even be here. but we are. it's like in the great stories, mr. frodo. the ones that really mattered. full of darkness and danger they were. and sometimes you didn't want to know the end  because how could the end be happy? how could the world go back to the way it was  when so much bad had happened? but in the end, it's only a passing thing  this shadow. even darkness must pass. a new day will come. and when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer. those were the stories that stayed with you  that meant something. even if you were too small to understand why. but i think, mr. frodo, i do understand. i know now. folk in those stories  had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't. they kept going  because they were holding on to something. that there's some good in this world, mr. frodo. and it's worth fighting for. captain faramir  you have shown your quality, sir. the very highest. come on, keep up. mr. frodo didn't mean for them rangers to hurt you. you know that, don't you? he was trying to save you, see? so there's no hard feelings. forgive and forget. very decent of you. very decent, indeed, gollum. i wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales. i wonder if people will ever say, "let's hear about frodo and the ring." and they'll say, "yes! that's one of my favorite stories." frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, dad? yes, my boy. the most famousest of hobbits. and that's saying a lot. now, mr. frodo, you shouldn't make fun. i was being serious. samwise the brave. we're not going to wait for you. come on. where is he? where has he gone? hey, gollum! where are you?  haven't you had any sleep, mr. frodo? i've gone and had too much. must be getting late. not before mr. frodo's had something to eat. here. oh, no, i'm not hungry. leastways, not for lembas bread. all right. we don't have that much left. we have to be careful or we're going to run out. you go ahead and eat that, mr. frodo. i've rationed it. there should be enough. the journey home. you treacherous little toad! i heard it from his own mouth. he means to murder us. you miserable little maggot! i'll stove your head in! call me a liar? you're a liar! i don't care! i can't do it, mr. frodo. i won't wait around for him to kill us! you don't see it, do you? he's a villain. i'm on your side, mr. frodo. it must be getting near teatime. leastways, it would be in decent places where there is still teatime. mr. frodo? what is it? yes, you will. of course you will. that's just morbid thinking. we're going there and back again  just like mr. bilbo. you'll see. mr. frodo, look. the king has got a crown again. no, mr. frodo! no. hey, what's in this tunnel? you listen to me, and you listen good and proper. anything happens to him, you have me to answer to. one sniff something's not right  one hair stands up on the back of my head, it's over. no more slinker. no more stinker. you're gone. got it? i'm watching you. nothing. just clearing something up. mr. frodo. get back, you! don't touch him! what are you up to? sneaking off, are we? all right. all right! you just startled me is all. what were you doing? fine. have it your own way. i'm sorry to wake you, mr. frodo. we have to be moving on. it's always dark here. it's gone! the elven bread. he took it. he must have! you're a lying rat! what did you do with it?! that's a filthy lie! you stinking, two-faced sneak! call me  i'll kill him! oh, my i'm sorry. i didn't mean it to go so far. i was just so so angry. here, just let's just rest a bit. no. no, you're not all right. you're exhausted. it's that gollum. it's this place. it's that thing around your neck. i could help a bit. i could carry it for a while. carry it for a while. i could carry it i could carry it. share the load share the load the load the load. i don't want to keep it. i just want to help. shut up, you! go away! get out of here! but he's a liar. he's poisoned you against me. you don't mean that. let him go, you filth. let him go! you will not touch him again. come on and finish it. back! mr. frodo. oh, no. frodo. mr. frodo. wake up. don't leave me here alone. don't go where i can't follow. wake up. not asleep. dead. not dead? samwise, you fool. that's for frodo! and for the shire! and that's for my old gaffer! not if i stick you first. let's get you out of here. begging your pardon, but they haven't. i thought i'd lost you. so i took it. only for safekeeping. come on, mr. frodo. we best find you some clothes. you can't go walking through mordor in naught but your skin. we did it, mr. frodo. we made it to mordor. we have to go in there, mr. frodo. there's nothing for it. come on. let's just make it down the hill for starters. look, the orcs  they're moving off. you see, mr. frodo  some luck at last. mr. frodo! stand up, mr. frodo. stand up! oh, no. what do i do? what do we do? what? get off of me! nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot. get off of me! we're going that way. straight as we can. there's no point carrying anything we're not sure to need. mr. frodo. look. there is light  and beauty up there  that no shadow can touch. take mine. there's a few drops left. i don't think there will be a return journey, mr. frodo. frodo, get down! hide! frodo! it's gone, mr. frodo. the light's passed on, away towards the north. something's drawn its gaze. do you remember the shire, mr. frodo? it'll be spring soon. and the orchards will be in blossom. and the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket. and they'll be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields  and eating the first of the strawberries with cream. do you remember the taste of strawberries? then let us be rid of it  once and for all. come on, mr. frodo. i can't carry it for you  but i can carry you. come on! look, mr. frodo. a doorway. we're almost there. frodo! frodo! destroy it! go on! now! throw it in the fire! what are you waiting for? just let it go! no. no. no! give me your hand! take my hand! no! don't you let go. don't let go. reach! yes, mr. frodo. it's over now. rosie cotton dancing. she had ribbons in her hair. if ever i was to marry someone  it would've been her. it would've been her. mr. frodo? what is it? “there and back again. a hobbit's tale by bilbo baggins. and the lord of the rings by frodo baggins." you finished it. what does he mean? you don't mean that. you can't leave. well  i'm back.
