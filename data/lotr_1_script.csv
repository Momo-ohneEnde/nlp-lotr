251	 GANDALF	 Bilbo Baggins do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks! Bilbo cowers from Gandalf, disarmed by his power...a frightened Hobbit. Gandalf's expression softens.
252	 GANDALF (CONT'D)	 I am not trying to rob you. I am trying to help you. Sobbing, Bilbo runs to Gandalf and hugs him.
253	 GANDALF (CONT'D)	 All you long years we've been friends...trust me as you once did. Let it go!
254	 BILBO	 You're right, Gandalf...the ring must go to Frodo.Bilbo lifts his knapsack and heads for the front door.

264	 ANGLE ON:	 Bilbo staggering out of Bag end...he braces himself in thenight air, Pale and Trembling, as if his loss of the ring hasweakened him. Gandalf steps up behind.
265	 BILBO	 I've thought up and ending for my book..."And he lived happily ever after to the end of his days."
266	 GANDALF	 I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

THE WITCH KING extends a haggard handtowards Frodo, reaching for the ring on his finger. Frodo'strembling hand extends forward as if by the pull of thering...he slides to the ground, unable to pull his hand away.The witch king snarls and springs forward. He stabs at Frodowith a wicked dagger! Frodo winces as the tip of the daggersinks into his shoulder. Suddenly, Strider charges at theRINGWRAITHS, wielding his sword in one hand, a flaming torchin the other. He moves in slow motion, visible through a seaof mist. Frodo sinks to the ground. Behind him is a faintimage of a Ringwraith fleeing, his head engulfed in flames.With draining strength, Frodo manages to pull the ring offhis finger...

Strange guttural chants echo up from deepunderground. The camera is rising...a small moth fluttersinto shot...and leads the camera towards the summit orOrthanc. Gandalf lies slumped against the wall at the verytop of Orthanc, surrounded by a sheer 500 foot drop. Helooks Weak and Frail...and is seemingly asleep. The MOTHflutters close to Gandalf.

979	 GIMLI	 (grim) The doom of man!
980	 BOROMIR	 It is a gift...a gift to the foes of Mordor! Why not use this Ring? Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor, held the forces of Mordor at bay...by the blood of our people are your lands kept safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy...let us use it against him!
981	 STRIDER	 You cannot wield it. None of us can. The one ring answers to Sauron alone...it has no other master. Boromir turns and looks at Strider, coolly.
982	 BOROMIR	 And what would a ranger know of this matter?Strider says nothing and Boromir turns away dismissively.LEGOLAS stands...
983	 LEGOLAS	 This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn. You owe him your allegiance.Frodo looks at Strider questioningly...Boromir turns sharply.
984	 BOROMIR	 (quiet disbelief) Aragorn? This is Isildur's heir?
985	 LEGOLAS	 And heir to the throne of Gondor.
986	 ARAGORN	 (Elvish: with subtitles) Havo dad, Legolas...Sit down, Legolas..

Gimli fallsbackwards, staring in disbelief at the ring...unharmed! Frodowinces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him! He slumpsin this chair, clutching his forehead. Gandalf looks at himwith concern.
994	 ELROND	 The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin, by any craft that we
995	 ELROND (CONT'D)	 here possess. The ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom...only there can it be unmade. It must be taken deep into Mordor, and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came. One of you must do this.Stunned silence...the council sits with downcast eyes, as ifa great dread has descended on them. Boromir addresses thecouncil in a quiet voice
996	 BOROMIR	 One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its black gates are guarded by more than just Orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful. It is a barren wasteland, riddled with fire and ash and dust...the very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with ten thousand men could you do this. It is folly.
997	 LEGOLAS	 Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The ring must be destroyed.
998	 GIMLI	 And I suppose you think you're the one to do it?
999	 BOROMIR	 And if we fail, what then? What happens when Sauron takes back what is his?Gimli leaps to his feet!

1005	 GANDALF	 Do you not understand? While we bicker among ourselves, Sauron's power grows! No one will escape it. You will all be destroyed, your homes burnt and your families put to the sword!CLOSE ON: FRODO...breathing rapidly, Caught in the grip ofhis hideous vision. With a huge effort or will, Frodo tearshis gaze upon the ring. Frodo suddenly stands...he speaks ina strong, clear voice.
1006	 FRODO	 I will take it...I will take it...I will take the Ring to Mordor.Sudden silence...Frodo looks around the room at the astoundedfaces.

1058	 GANDALF	 No, Gimli. I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice.Boromir thrusts, catching Pippin on the hand. Pippin throwsdown his sword, kicks and lunges at Boromir, tackling him tothe ground. Much laughter. Legolas' eyes are fixed on adistant Dark Patch which darts about the sky, like flyingsmoke in the wind.

1379	 FRODO	 I know what you would say, and it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart.
1380	 BOROMIR	 Warning? Against what?Boromir has started forward towards Frodo, he pulls himselfup.

1384	 BOROMIR (CONT'D)	 We are all afraid, Frodo. But to let that fear drive us to destroy what hope we have...don't you see that is madness?
1385	 FRODO	 There is no other way.
1386	 BOROMIR	 I ask only for the strength to defend my people. (angrily drops the wood he has collected) If you would but lend me the ring...
1387	 FRODO	 No. . .Frodo steps hurriedly away from Boromir.
1388	 BOROMIR	 Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
1389	 FRODO	 (wary) You are not yourself.
1390	 BOROMIR	 What chance do you think you have? They will find you, they will take the ring and you will beg for death before the end.Frodo turns to leave.
1391	 BOROMIR (CONT'D)	 You fool! It is not yours save by unhappy chance...it might have been mine. It should be mine. Give it to me! Give me the ring.Boromir leaps on top of Frodo, grasping for the ring! Frodohas only moments to act. Frodo rips the ring from around hisneck..and rams it on his finger.
1392	 FRODO DISAPPEARS	 Boromir spins wildly around, yelling into thin air!
1393	 BOROMIR	 I see your mind...you will take the ring to Sauron. You will betray us! You go to your death and the death of us all.

1400	 EXT. SEEING SEAT -- DAY	 
1401	 IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD:	 FRODO races through the misty twilight world, past the foggyshapes of twisted trees. Somewhere behind him, Boromir'sdistraught voice carries from another dimension:
1402	 BOROMIR (O.S.)	 I'm sorry, Frodo...Frodo...Frodo suddenly finds himself on the stone steps...he clambersup the stairs, onto a high seat, perched on four stonepillars. Frodo cowers on the seat, like a lost child upon thethrone of mountain kings. The world of mist swirls aroundhim. Frodo peers out from the seat...the world seems toshrink. In all directions, Views of far off lands telescopetowards him through the mist. IMAGES: ORCS spilling out ofholes in the misty mountains... flames rising fromMirkwood...grim faced easterlings march to war...black shipssailing into the south. All the power of the Dark Lord is inmotion. Frodo moves his gaze towards the east...fire explodesagainst the smoke, as a huge mass of black battlements fillsFrodo's vision. A mountain of iron, immeasurably strong,tower of adamant: Barad-dur, FORTRESS OF SAURON!
1403	 SUDDENLY!   SAURON'S EYE LEAPS TOWARD FRODO LIKE A FINGER OF	 
1404	 LIGHT.	 
1405	 SAURON (V.O.)	 
1406	 (IN BLACK SPEECH)	 They will fall! Frodo leaps off the seat, and tumbles downthe stairs! The eye sweeps Amon Hen like a searchlight,seeking its ring! With a huge effort, Frodo wrenches the ringoff his finger...
1407	 EXT. SUMMIT OF AMON HEN -- DAY	 Frodo lies gasping on the summit of Amon Hen...below theancient ruins of the seeing seat.
1408	 111.	 
1409	 AT THAT MOMENT: A BLACK BOOT STEPS INTO SHOT!	 Frodo looks up as Aragorn towers over him.
1410	 ARAGORN	 Frodo?
1411	 FRODO	 (numb) It has taken Boromir. ARAGORN moves towards Frodo...
1412	 ARAGORN	 (urgent) Where is the ring?Frodo backs away from Aragorn...Aragorn is shocked by themovement.
1413	 FRODO	 Stay away!
1414	 ARAGORN	 Frodo...I swore to protect you.
1415	 FRODO	 Can you protect me from yourself?Frodo uncurls his fist...in is palm lies the ring! Itglints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun...Aragorn'seyes are drawn to it.
1416	 FRODO (CONT'D)	 Would you destroy it?
1417	 ARAGORN	 (kneeling to Frodo) I would have gone with you to the end... into the very fires of Mordor.
1418	 FRODO	 I know...Look after the others, especially Sam...he will not understand.Aragorn freezes! He draws his sword.
1419	 ARAGORN	 (urgent) Go, Frodo!Frodo hesitates.

Run!!Frodo backs away into the trees...as 200 URUK-HAI SWARM ontoAmon Hen behind Aragorn!Aragorn attacks the leading URUK-HAI like a madman... hebrings two down with his sword...leaping into the ruins asothers close in on him. Frodo scrambles down the hillside,away from the fight. Aragorn battles the URUK-HAI, amongstthe pillars and blocks of Amon Hen. Despite his bravery, heis quickly surrounded... SUDDENLY: ELVEN ARROWS smash intothe URUK-HAI. Legolas races out of the woods, firing his bow.Gimli leaps into the battle, wielding his might axe.
1424	 EXT. PARTH GALEN HILLSIDE -- DAY	 Frodo is darting down the steep hillside as heave feetthunder down behind him.
1425	 SAM	 Mr. Frodo!Sam looks around for Frodo. CLOSE ON: LURTZ ordering his
1426	 URUKS.	 
1427	 LURTZ	 Find the Halflings ... find the halflings!Frodo stumbles and falls...quickly he crawls behind atree...above him the sound of Uruk-Hai crashing through theforest rings out.
1428	 MERRY (O.S.)	 (urgent whisper) Frodo!Frodo turns to see Merry and Pippin hidden in a hollow, a fewfeet away.
1429	 MERRY (CONT'D)	 Hide here, quick!
1430	 PIPPIN	 Come on...Frodo looks at his friends... slowly shakes his head, a greatsadness in his eyes...
1431	 PIPPIN (CONT'D)	 What's he doing?

1437	 MERRY	 Pippin!THE ECHO OF BOROMIR'S HORN reaches Aragorn, Legolas, andGimli...they are battling their way down the Slopes towardsthe lake.
1438	 LEGOLAS	 The horn of Gondor!
1439	 ARAGORN	 Boromir!Aragorn desperately slashes his way towards Boromir, fellingURUK-HAI in his path...while Legolas and Gimli fight a rearguard action. MANY URUK-HAI fall to Boromir's sword as hetries to protect Merry and Pippin...
1440	 BOROMIR	 Run! Run!Lurtz takes aim. A black arrow suddenly thuds into Boromir'schest. Amazingly, Boromir continues fighting, but anotherarrow...and another, brings him to his knees. Merry andPippin are scooped off their feet by URUK-HAI.
1441	 MERRY & PIPPIN	 Aaaaagh! Boromir! Boromir!Lurtz aims his bow at Boromir's heart... suddenly Aragorncharges at him, smashing the Bow with his sword. They lockinto a deadly battle. Aragorn cuts Lurtz down and racestowards Boromir, who lies slumped against a tree...URUK-HAIarrows sticking out of his chest. At least 20 dead URUK-HAIlie heaped around Boromir. His horn lies at his feet...Clovenin two.
1442	 BOROMIR	 (painful gasp) They took the little ones...

1449	 ARAGORN	 I let Frodo go.Boromir holds Aragorn's gaze.
1450	 BOROMIR	 Then you did what I could not. I tried to take the ring from him.
1451	 ARAGORN	 The ring is beyond our reach now.
1452	 BOROMIR	 Forgive me, I did not see..I have failed you all.
1453	 ARAGORN	 No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You have kept your honor. Aragorn tries to bind Boromir's wound.
1454	 BOROMIR	 Leave it! It is over...the world of Men will fall and all will come to darkness and my city to ruin..Aragorn..
1455	 ARAGORN	 I do not know what strength is in my blood, but I swear to you... I will not let the White City fall, nor your people fail...
1456	 BOROMIR	 Our people...our people...Aragorn places Boromir's sword in his hand. Boromir'sfingers tighten around the hilt.
1457	 BOROMIR (CONT'D)	 I would have followed you, my brother...my captain, my King. Aragorn lays Boromir down. He is dead.

1465	 EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL -- DAY	 On the lakeshore Frodo stands in front of one of the ElvishBoats, the ring in his palm. A distraught Sam...running ashard as he can through the forest...
1466	 SAM	 Mr. Frodo!Close on: Frodo looks to the far side of the river...thecamera moves in on the ring.
1467	 FRODO (V.O.)	 I wish the ring had never come to me..I wish none of this had happened...Tears fall down Frodo's face...
1468	 GANDALF (V.O.)	 So do all who lie to see such times...but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.With renewed determination, Frodo tucks the ring inside hisvest pocket. The small figure of Frodo pushing the Elvishboat into the water... Sam bursts through the trees and runstoward the lake...Frodo is already paddling away.
1469	 SAM	 (anguished) Not alone, Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo, in the boat, paddling steadfastly away from theshore..tears in his eyes..the voice of Sam carried on thewind. Frodo whispers to himself

1477	 FRODO (CONT'D)	 (frightened) Sam!Sam is underwater...hands flailing helplessly as he sinks.Close on: Frodo's hand grasping Sam's... Frodo pulls abedraggled and half drowned Sam into the boat. Frodo and Samlook at each other, out of breath, tears and water streamingdown both their faces.
1478	 SAM	 I made a promise, Mr. Frodo...a promise. (fierce passion) "Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee." (sobs) And I don't mean to...I don't mean to.
