 you draw far too much attention to yourself, “mr. underhill.” a little more caution from you. that is no trinket you carry. indeed. i can avoid being seen if i wish  but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift. are you frightened? not nearly frightened enough. i know what hunts you. you have a stout heart, little hobbit. but that will not save you. you can no longer wait for the wizard, frodo. they're coming. they were once men. great kings of men. then sauron the deceiver gave to them nine rings of power. blinded by their greed, they took them without question. one by one, falling into darkness. now they are slaves to his will. they are the nazgã»l. ringwraiths. neither living nor dead. at all times they feel  the presence of the ring  drawn to the power of the one. they will never stop hunting you. into the wild. to rivendell, master gamgee. to the house of elrond. gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall. you've already had it. tinúviel the elven-fair. immortal maiden elven-wise. about him cast her night-dark hair. and arms like silver glimmering. 'tis the lay of luthien. the elf-maiden who gave her love to beren, a mortal. she died. get some sleep, frodo. this was the great watchtower of amon sûl. we shall rest here tonight. these are for you. keep them close. i'm going to have a look around. stay here. he's been stabbed by a morgul blade. this is beyond my skill to heal. he needs elvish medicine. hurry! hold on, frodo. he's passing into the shadow world. he'll soon become a wraith like them. sam, do you know the athelas plant? kingsfoil. it may help to slow the poisoning. hurry! stay with the hobbits, i'll send horses for you. the road is very dangerous. as you wish. arwen  ride hard. don't look back. men of the south are welcome here. i am a friend to gandalf the grey. the same blood flows in my veins. the same weakness. i thought i had strayed into a dream. you said you'd bind yourself to me  forsaking the immortal life of your people. you cannot give me this. you cannot wield it. none of us can. the one ring answers to sauron alone. it has no other master.  sit down, legolas. if by my life or death i can protect you  i will. you have my sword. i do not want that power. i have never wanted it. move your feet. gentlemen, that's enough. hide! take cover! frodo! boromir. boromir! give the ring to frodo. he's trying to bring down the mountain! gandalf, we must turn back! the gap of rohan takes us too close to isengard! mines are no place for a pony. even one so brave as bill. go on, bill. go on. don't worry, sam, he knows the way home. do not disturb the water. into the cave! run! get back! stay close to gandalf! frodo! frodo! oh, no. you should be dead. that spear would have skewered a wild boar. gandalf. sam! steady. hold on! hang on! lean forward! steady. now! legolas, get them up. by nightfall, these hills will be swarming with orcs. we must reach the woods of lothlórien. come, boromir. legolas. gimli, get them up. on your feet, sam. frodo? frodo! haldir. that was not so courteous. we need your protection. the road is very dangerous. merin le telim. i wish we may come with you. we need your support! i wish we may come with you. the road is very dangerous. take some rest. these borders are well-protected. i have seen the white city  long ago. i wish that she endures, even if we separate  beyond the limits of this world. i wish that she sails to valinor. gollum. he has tracked us since moria. i had hoped we would lose him on the river. but he's too clever a waterman. there is no strength in gondor that can avail us. i will not lead the ring within a hundred leagues of your city. frodo. the argonath. long have i desired to look upon the kings of old. my kin. we cross the lake at nightfall. hide the boats and continue on foot. we approach mordor from the north. that is our road. i suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, master dwarf. no. orcs patrol the eastern shore. we must wait for cover of darkness. frodo? where is the ring? frodo! i swore to protect you. i would have gone with you to the end. into the very fires of mordor. go, frodo! run. run! elendil! boromir. no. hold still. i let frodo go. the ring is beyond our reach now. no, boromir. you fought bravely. you have kept your honor. i do not know what strength is in my blood  but i swear to you, i will not let the white city fall  nor our people fail. be at peace  son of gondor. they will look for his coming from the white tower. but he will not return. frodo's fate is no longer in our hands. not if we hold true to each other. we will not abandon merry and pippin to torment and death. not while we have strength left. leave all that can be spared behind. we travel light. let us hunt some orc.  their pace has quickened. they must have caught our scent. hurry! not idly do the leaves of lorien fall. less than a day ahead of us. come. rohan. home of the horse-lords. there's something strange at work here. some evil gives speed to these creatures. sets its will against us. legolas! what do your elf-eyes see? saruman. riders of rohan  what news from the mark? i am aragorn, son of arathorn. this is gimli, son of gloin, and legolas of the woodland realm. we are friends of rohan and of theoden, your king. we are no spies. we track a party of uruk-hai westward across the plain. they have taken two of our friends captive. they would be small. only children to your eyes. a hobbit lay here. and the other. they crawled. their hands were bound. their bonds were cut. they ran over here. they were followed. tracks lead away from the battle  into fangorn forest. these are strange tracks. gimli! lower your ax. what do you see? do not let him speak. he will put a spell on us. we must be quick. where are they? who are you? show yourself! it cannot be. you fell. gandalf. we hear of trouble in rohan. it goes ill with the king. in one thing you have not changed, dear friend. you still speak in riddles. he's not alone. sam went with him. wait. no, my lord! no, my lord. let him go. enough blood has been spilt on his account. you have 2000 good men riding north as we speak. eomer is loyal to you. his men will return and fight for their king. open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not. he's only doing what he thinks is best for his people. helm's deep has saved them in the past. they will hold. go. fast  quiet now. fast  quiet  quiet  quiet  quiet  a battle is stirring, you heard. what is your name? what is your name? brego. your name is kingly. what troubles you, brego? what did you see? i was raised in rivendell  for a time. turn this fellow free. he's seen enough of war. you have some skill with a blade. what do you fear, my lady? you're a daughter of kings  a shield maiden of rohan. i do not think that would be your fate. it's the beards. thank you. it's good. king theoden has a good memory. he was only a small child at the time. eighty-seven. there are few of us left. the northern kingdom was destroyed long ago. i am asleep. this is a dream. you told me once  this day would come. my path is hidden from me. arwen  but never more than memory. she stays because she still has hope. i shall not return. i do not speak of death in battle. the way is open to you  the way to another life  away from war grief, despair. i am mortal. you are elf-kind. it was a dream, arwen. nothing more. this belongs to you. she is sailing to the undying lands with all that is left of her kin. warg! we're under attack! get them out of here! brego. well done, brego, my friend. gimli, where is the king? thank you. all isengard is emptied. ten thousand strong at least. it is an army bred for a single purpose: to destroy the world of men. they will be here by nightfall. they do not come to destroy rohan's crops or villages. they come to destroy its people  down to the last child. send out riders, my lord. you must call for aid. gondor will answer. we'll place the reserves along the wall. they can support the archers from above the gate. that is an honorable charge. my lady, a time may come for valor without renown. who then will your people look to in the last defense? it is not in my power to command it. farmers, farriers, stable boys. these are no soldiers. they have more hope of defending themselves here than at edoras then i shall die as one of them! give me your sword. what is your name? this is a good sword. haleth, son of hama  there is always hope. there is nothing to forgive, legolas. well met, haldir! you are most welcome. o, children of eru  show them no mercy… for you shall receive none! hold! prepare to fire! release arrows! ladders! swords! swords! causeway! bring him down, legolas! kill him! kill him! gimli! hurl the arrows! charge! to the keep! pull back! haldir! pull back! haldir! how long do you need? gimli! it's a long way. what? not a word. hurry! inside. get them inside! you said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it. they still defend it. they have died defending it. is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves? is there no other way? send word for the women and children to make for the mountain pass. and barricade the entrance! ride out with me. ride out and meet them. for rohan. for your people. gandalf.  show yourself. pippin! no news of frodo? we have time. every day, frodo moves closer to mordor. what does your heart tell you? not yet dawn. night changes many thoughts. sleep, eowyn. sleep  while you can. i will go. they must be warned. merry! one thing i have learned about hobbits: they're a most hardy folk. the beacons of minas tirith! the beacons are lit! gondor calls for aid. will you ride with us? six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of mordor. every hour lost hastens gondor's defeat. we have till dawn, then we must ride. my lord elrond. it will not be our end, but his. there are none. murderers  traitors. you would call upon them to fight? they believe in nothing. they answer to no one. sauron will not have forgotten the sword of elendil. the blade that was broken shall return to minas tirith. i keep none for myself. eowyn  why have you come? it is but a shadow and a thought that you love. i cannot give you what you seek. i have wished you joy since first i saw you. not this time. this time you must stay, gimli. brego! i do not fear death. do not look down. one who will have your allegiance. you will suffer me. i summon you to fulfill your oath. it has been remade. fight for us  and regain your honor. what say you? what say you? i am isildur's heir. fight for me  and i will hold your oaths fulfilled. what say you? you have my word! fight, and i will release you from this living death! what say you?! out! legolas! run! you may go no further. you will not enter gondor. legolas, fire a warning shot past the bosun's ear. this army. legolas! i hold your oath fulfilled. go. be at peace. if sauron had the ring, we would know it. no. there is still hope for frodo. he needs time and safe passage across the plains of gorgoroth. we can give him that. draw out sauron's armies. empty his lands. then we gather our full strength and march on the black gate. not for ourselves. but we can give frodo his chance if we keep sauron's eye fixed upon us. keep him blind to all else that moves. oh, i think he will. long have you hunted me. long have i eluded you. no more. behold the sword of elendil. let the lord of the black land come forth! let justice be done upon him! i do not believe it. i will not. pull back. pull back! hold your ground! hold your ground. sons of gondor, of rohan, my brothers! i see in your eyes  the same fear that would take the heart of me. a day may come when the courage of men fails  when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship. but it is not this day. an hour of wolves and shattered shields  when the age of men comes crashing down. but it is not this day. this day we fight! by all that you hold dear on this good earth  i bid you stand, men of the west! for frodo. this day does not belong to one man  but to all. let us together rebuild this world  that we may share in the days of peace. out of the great sea  to middle-earth i am come. in this place will i abide  and my heirs  unto the ending of the world. thank you. my friends  you bow to no one.
