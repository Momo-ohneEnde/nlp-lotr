 you're late. it's wonderful to see you, gandalf! you know bilbo. he's got the whole piece in an uproar. half the shire's been invited. and the rest of them are turning up anyway. to tell you the truth, bilbo's been a bit odd lateiy. i mean, more than usual. he's taken to locking himself in his study. he spends hours and hours poring over old maps when he thinks i'm not looking. he's up to something. all right, then. keep your secrets. but i know you have something to do with it. before you came along, we bagginses were very well thought of. never had any adventures or did anything unexpected. whatever you did, you've been officially labeled a disturber of the peace. gandalf? i'm glad you're back. go on, sam. ask rosie for a dance. oh, no, you don't. go on! bilbo? bilbo, have you been at the gaffer's home brew? bilbo. bilbo, watch out for the dragon! speech! bilbo! bilbo! he's gone, hasn't he? he talked for so long about leaving  i didn't think he'd really do it. gandalf? where are you going? what things? you've only just arrived. i don't understand. and proud of it. cheers, gaffer. don't worry, sam. rosie knows an idiot when she sees one. good night, sam. what are you doing? nothing. there's nothing. wait. there are markings. it's some form of elvish. i can't read it. mordor! bilbo found it. in gollum's cave. but he was destroyed. sauron was destroyed. all right. we put it away. we keep it hidden. we never speak of it again. no one knows it's here, do they? do they, gandalf? shire. baggins. but that would lead them here! take it, gandalf! take it! you must take it! i'm giving it to you! but it cannot stay in the shire! what must i do? where? where do i go? bree. what about you? and the ring will be safe there? i can cut across country easily enough. this is what? come on, sam. remember what bilbo used to say: “it's a dangerous business, frodo.” sam. wood-elves. they're going to the harbor beyond the white towers. to the grey havens. never to return. just shut your eyes  and imagine you're back in your own bed  with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow. me neither, sam. what are you taking about? what did he say? sam, we're still in the shire. what could possibly happen? what's the meaning of this? i think we should get off the road. get off the road! quick! nothing. i have to leave the shire. sam and i must get to bree. go! how far to the nearest crossing? come on. we're heading for the prancing pony. we wish to stay at the inn. our business is our own. excuse me. underhill. my name's underhill. we're friends of gandalf the grey. can you tell him we've arrived? sam  he'll be here. he'll come. excuse me. that man in the corner. who is he? strider. pippin! what do you want? i carry nothing. who are you? yes. what are they? where are you taking us? i think a servant of the enemy would look fairer  and feel fouler. we have no choice but to trust him. who is she? this woman you sing of. what happened to her? what are you doing?! put it out, you fools! put it out! go! oh, sam. gandalf! where am i? gandalf! what happened, gandalf? why didn't you meet us? gandalf? what is it? sam. bilbo! bilbo. there and back again a hobbit's tale, by bilbo baggins.'' this is wonderful. i miss the shire. i spent all my childhood pretending i was off somewhere else. off with you, on one of your adventures. but my own adventure turned out to be quite different. i'm not like you, bilbo. packed already? i thought you wanted to see the elves. more than anything. you are right, sam. we did what we set out to do. the ring will be safe in rivendell. i am ready to go home. i will take it. i will take it. i will take the ring to mordor. though  i do not know the way. it's so light. mordor, gandalf, is it left or right? we will go through the mines. better than it was. who then do i trust? what do you mean? it's a riddle. “speak 'friend' and enter.” what's the elvish word for “friend”? help! help! there's something down there. gollum? he escaped the dungeons of barad-dûr? it's a pity bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance. i wish the ring had never come to me. i wish none of this had happened. aragorn! aragorn! i'm all right. i'm not hurt. gandalf! gandalf! no! what will i see? if you ask it of me  i will give you the one ring. i cannot do this alone. then i know what i must do. it's just  i'm afraid to do it. no, sam. i'm all right. you can't help me, sam. not this time. get some sleep. i know what you would say. it would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart. there is no other way. no. you are not yourself. no! no. it has taken boromir. stay away! can you protect me from yourself? would you destroy it? i know. look after the others. especially sam. he will not understand. i wish the ring had never come to me. i wish none of this had happened. no, sam. go back, sam! i'm going to mordor alone. you can't swim! sam! sam! oh sam. come on. mordor. i hope the others find a safer road. i don't suppose we'll ever see them again. sam  i'm glad you're with me.  gandalf! gandalf! no! gandalf! gandalf! nothing. just a dream. no! don't look down, sam! just keep going! i think i've found the bottom. what's in this? roast chicken?! sam. my dear sam. it is special. it's a little bit of home. we can't leave this here for someone to follow us down. real elvish rope. he didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, sam  but they did. it's getting heavier. what food have we got left? nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, sam? it's because we've been here before. we're going in circles. yes. i can smell it. we're not alone. this is sting. you've seen it before  haven't you, gollum? release him or i'll cut your throat. maybe he does deserve to die. but now that i see him, i do pity him. there's no promise you can make that i can trust. the ring is treacherous. it will hold you to your word. sam! you know the way to mordor? you've been there before? you will lead us to the black gate. here. don't touch me! gollum? gollum! what did you say? who are you? gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk. he said your life was a sad story. you were not so very different from a hobbit once. were you? smeagol. that was your name once, wasn't it? a long time ago. i did. sam, no! i do not ask you to come with me, sam. now! are you saying there's another way into mordor? he's led us this far, sam. he's been true to his word. lead the way, smeagol. why do you do that? call him names. run him down all the time. you have no idea what it did to him  what it's still doing to him. i want to help him, sam. because i have to believe he can come back. what do you know about it? nothing! i'm sorry, sam. i don't know why i said that. i know what i have to do, sam. the ring was entrusted to me. it's my task. mine! my own! we've got to get moving. come on, sam. smeagol? we've lingered here too long. come on, sam. we are bound to an errand of secrecy. those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us. we are hobbits of the shire. frodo baggins is my name, and this is samwise gamgee. there was no other. we set out from rivendell with seven companions. one we lost in moria  two were my kin  a dwarf there was also. and an elf and two men. aragorn, son of arathorn, and boromir of gondor. yes. for my part. dead? how? when? if something has happened to boromir, we would have you tell us. wait. this creature is bound to me. and i to him. he is our guide. please  let me go down to him. smeagol. master is here. come, smeagol. trust master. come. smeagol, you must trust master. follow me. come on. come. come, smeagol. nice smeagol. that's it. come on. don't hurt him! smeagol, don't struggle. smeagol, listen to me. i can't. you were right, sam. you tried to tell me but  i'm sorry. the ring's taking me, sam. if i put it on  he'll find me. he'll see. no! the ring will not save gondor. it has only the power to destroy. please  let me go. faramir! you must let me go! it's calling to him, sam. his eye is almost on me. they're here. they've come. i can't do this, sam. what are we holding on to, sam? gollum says there's a path  near minas morgul that climbs up into the mountains. i must. thank you. what? well, you've left out one of the chief characters: samwise the brave. i want to hear more about sam. frodo wouldn't have got far without sam. so was i. smeagol? smeagol?  no. it isn't. it isn't midday yet. the days are growing darker. what about you? sam. for what? no, sam! leave him alone! sam! you scare him off, we're lost! i'm not sending him away. we can't do this by ourselves, sam. not without a guide. i need you on my side. i know, sam. i know. trust me. come, smeagol. it's just a feeling. i don't think i'll be coming back. i think these lands were once part of the kingdom of gondor. long ago, when there was a king. they're calling me. i can feel his blade. what was that about? it's dark still. what? that's all we have left. he doesn't eat it. he can't have taken it. sam! stop it! sam! sam! no! i'm all right. get away! no, sam. it's you. i'm sorry, sam. you can't help me anymore. go home. what is this place? now that i'm here, i don't think i want to. i can't go back. what's that smell? smeagol? it's sticky. what is it? smeagol? smeagol! smeagol! sam. hail earendil brightest of the stars! no! i have to destroy it, smeagol. i have to destroy it for both our sakes. i'm so sorry, sam. i'm so sorry. sam! oh, sam, i'm so sorry. sorry for everything. it's too late. it's over. they've taken it. sam  they took the ring. give it to me. give me the ring, sam. sam. give me the ring. you must understand. the ring is my burden. it will destroy you, sam. there are so many of them. we'll never get through unseen. it's him, the eye. sam, help me. it's so heavy. hit me. hit me, sam. start fighting. go, sam. now! i can't  i can't i can't manage the ring, sam. it's it's  it's such a weight to carry. it's  such a weight. there will be none left for the return journey. no, sam. i can't recall the taste of food  nor the sound of water  nor the touch of grass. i'm  naked in the dark. there's there's nothing. no veil between me and the wheel of fire. i can see him  with my waking eyes. you swore! you swore on the precious! smeagol promised! i'm here, sam. the ring is mine. it's gone. it's done. i can see the shire. the brandywine river. bag end. gandalf's fireworks. the lights in the party tree. i'm glad to be with you, samwise gamgee  here at the end of all things. gandalf? gimli! and thus it was. a fourth age of middle-earth began. and the fellowship of the ring  though eternally bound by friendship and love  was ended. thirteen months to the day since gandalf sent us on our long journey  we found ourselves looking upon a familiar sight. we were home. how do you pick up the threads of an old life? how do you go on  when in your heart you begin to understand  there is no going back? there are some things that time cannot mend  some hurts that go too deep  that have taken hold. it's been four years to the day since weathertop, sam. it's never really healed. not quite. there's room for a little more. bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end  that each of us must come and go in the telling. bilbo's story was now over. there would be no more journeys for him  save one. to the harbor, bilbo. the elves have accorded you a special honor  a place on the last ship to leave middle-earth. i'm sorry, uncle. i'm afraid i lost it. we set out to save the shire, sam. and it has been saved. but not for me. the last pages are for you, sam. my dear sam: you cannot always be torn in two. you will have to be one and whole for many years. you have so much to enjoy and to be and to do. your part in the story will go on.
