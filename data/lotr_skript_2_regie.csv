Gandalf, exhausted, leans on his staff and watches the Balrog fall then turns to follow the others. At the last minute, the flaming whip lashes up from the depths of the abyss and winds around Gandalf's ankle, dragging him over the edge.

As they continue to plunge into the depths, Gandalf hacks away at the Balrog even as it thrashes and bounces off the walls. They continue to plunge at great speed, sometimes with Gandalf clinging to the horn of the demon. The battling pair then falls into an enormous cavern and plunges into the water. Just then Frodo awakens as if from a nightmare.|2
58|Regie|Lies back down.|2
60|Regie|Frodo and Sam climbs over the rocky terrain Emyn Muil. They look into the distance at the Mountain of Fire.|2

100|Regie|Gollum reaches out his hand towards the hobbits. Suddenly the hobbits spring up, grab hold of Gollum's arms and pull him down. Amidst the struggle, Gollum wriggles loose and leaps onto Frodo. As Frodo falls back, the chain and Ring around his neck is revealed and Gollum jumps straight for the Ring. Sam tries to grab at him but is knocked away. Gollum now jumps on top of Frodo and tries to reach for the Ring even as Frodo grabs his hands and tries to push him away. Gollum's cheeks puff with exertion as he struggles with Frodo, his enormous eyes fixed on the Ring. Sam grabs hold of Gollum again and tears him away from Frodo. Gollum then turns around and bites Sam on the shoulder, wriggles around and clasps his arms around Sam's neck and legs around his waist in a death grip. Frodo unsheathes Sting and holds it to Gollum's throat.|2
102|Regie|menacingly|2
104|Regie|Slowly, Gollum loosens his grip on Sam and as the latter disentangles himself, Gollum wails. In the next scene, Gollum is being dragged with Sam's Elvish rope around his neck, wailing and writhing in pain.|2

456|Regie|They break into a run and then stop|2
458|Regie|The Three looks up into a dense and dark forest|2
464|Regie|Scene moves from the trackers into the nighttime chase of Merry and Pippin. The hobbits run into the Fangorn, seeking to lose the pursuing Orc. They collapse onto the ground, out of breath.|2
466|Regie|Looks around|2
468|Regie|Suddenly, Grishnak appears from behind the trees, brandishing a blade.|2
472|Regie|Merry and Pippin run and hide behind a tree.|2
476|Regie|Pippin and Merry quickly scramble up a tree each.|2

484|Regie|Pippin looks down in horror but as he turns his head, he spots a pair of gleaming yellow eyes blinking in the tree he's clinging to. The tree starts to move and groan.|2
490|Regie|Pippin loses his grip in fright and grabs at the air futilely as he falls. The tree catches him before he hits the ground.|2
492|Regie|Suddenly he senses something behind him and as he looks up, the tree stomps and squashes him onto the forest floor.|2
496|Regie|Merry tries to run away but is scooped by the tree.|2

538|Regie|Sam's foot slipped into muck.|2
544|Regie|Gollum looks back and gestures for the hobbits to follow.|2
548|Regie|The marsh lands stretch for miles and miles as far as the eye can see. The hobbits and Gollum appear as little specks. As the three pick their way gingerly though the marshes, they see faces floating in the water, still, rotting and pale, and flickering flames on the swamps.|2
552|Regie|Turns to face the hobbits.|2
554|Regie|Sam's foot slips again into the water.|2
560|Regie|Frodo is drawn to one of the faces in Elven armour. He stares at it intently, until suddenly its eyes open and Frodo falls face-down into the water.|2
564|Regie|Frodo is in the water and sees many faces of the dead, no longer still but screaming and grasping, their rotten robes and hair flowing about their gruesome faces. Their hands are reaching for him. Suddenly he is grabbed from behind. Frodo sputters and gasps for air as Gollum pulls him out of the water.|2
566|Regie|Looks at Gollum in perplexed gratitude and disbelief.|2
568|Regie|Crawls away|2
570|Regie|Runs to Frodo's side.|2
572|Regie|Frodo lies panting, staring after Gollum|2
576|Regie|NIGHTFALL Sam is asleep but Frodo is still awake. He is holding the Ring in the palm of his hand and stroking it, mesmerized. Suddenly he hears Gollum.|2
578|Regie|Frodo quickly puts the Ring back inside his shirt. He looks up to see Gollum crouching away from him, stroking the centre of his palm|2
584|Regie|Moves over and crouches in front of Gollum|2
598|Regie|Looks up slowly.|2
604|Regie|Suddenly, the piercing cries of the Nazgul are heard overhead|2
614|Regie|Suddenly Frodo feels the pain of the Nazgul's sword piercing him and the call of the Ring. Images of the Ringwraiths come to him in flashes.|2
620|Regie|Frodo continues to clutch at the Ring on his chest, immobilized. Sam drags Frodo across to hide beneath some bramble bushes. The Nazgul appears, tightening his hold on the reins. Camera then shows him riding a Fell Beast, swooping down across the marsh lands. Chilling screams of the Nazgul fill the air.|2
628|Regie|A loud screech from the Nazgul flying high above the marshes.|2

678|Regie|With a yell, the three swing round to attack. Gimli's axe and Legolas' arrow are deflected. Aragorn drops his sword as it becomes red hot in his grasp. They shield their eyes with their hands from the bright light emanating from the White Wizard.|2
688|Regie|The bright light dims, revealing Gandalf, all dressed in white. The three are astounded. Legolas and Gimli bow.|2
692|Regie|Flashback: Gandalf is battling the Balrog atop Durin's Tower.|2
694|Regie|Gandalf holds up Glamdring and a flash of lightning strikes it before he plunges the sword into the Balrog. With a final cry, the Balrog falls from the peak and lands, smoking, onto the icy mountainside.|2
698|Regie|On top of the mountain, Gandalf crawls a bit and then collapses.|2
700|Regie|Camera zooms in Gandalf's eye and enters an amorphous realm of stars and galaxies, ending in a blinding white light|2
702|Regie|Camera zooms out from Gandalf's eye, lying naked and very still. His hair has turned white and wounds are completely healed. He suddenly shudders with a deep gasp and pants as life returns to him|2
708|Regie|He smiles|2
712|Regie|With a twinkle in his eyeAragorn grins|2
714|Regie|They walk through the forest, with Gandalf leading the way, now wearing a grey cloak over his white robes.|2

748|Regie|Orcs are patrolling the Black Gate.|2
752|Regie|A command is heard and an Orc sounds a horn, signalling for the Gate to be opened. Two enormous cave trolls stretch and growl and then pull the mighty Gate open.|2
756|Regie|He moves closer to the edge. Suddenly, the rock underneath him gives way and he falls.|2
762|Regie|Frodo goes after Sam.|2
766|Regie|Two Easterling soldiers see streams of dust coming down the cliff made by Sam and Frodo. They move away from the troop to investigate. Frodo reaches Sam who is stuck in the scree. As the Easterlings move closer and closer, Frodo throws his Elvish cloak over himself and Sam. The soldiers are now directly in front of Sam, but their eyes see nothing but rock. Frodo and Sam peer from underneath the cloak. The soldiers soon leave and after a moment, Frodo throws back the cloak and pulls Sam out.|2
772|Regie|They prepare to make a run for the Gate.|2

828|Regie|At Edoras, Eowyn is weeping at the dead Theodred's bed. She kisses his hand. Grima appears at the door.|2

840|Regie|He puts a hand on her cheek and moves down to her throat.|2
844|Regie|Eowyn and Grima stare at each other intently.|2
848|Regie|Eowyn runs out of the hall. Weeping, she looks away into the distance. A flag comes off its pole and is carried by the breeze. Eowyn sees riders coming towards Edoras. As Aragorn passes the entrance to Edoras, the flag floats down to land near him. Edoras is silent and somber. Everyone is dressed in black and staring at the newcomers in wary silence. Aragorn looks up at the hall and sees a lady in white standing on the steps. He looks around at more somber people.|2

876|Regie|He walks towards Gandalf.|2
878|Regie|Raises his staff against Grima.|2

Theoden's head rises again and his face begins to change gradually into that of a much younger-looking man. Clarity and recognition returns to his eyes.|2
916|Regie|Looks closely at Eowyn|2
918|Regie|Eowyn weeps with joy|2
