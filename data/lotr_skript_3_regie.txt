SMEAGOL and his cousin, DEAGOL, sit in a SMALL CORACLE, their FISHING LINES draped over the side SUNSHINE glinting off the surface of the water. An idyllic image. SUDDENLY DEAGOL's FISHING ROD BENDS under the weight of a LARGE FISH. DEAGOL pulls on his ROD, but is HAULED OVERBOARD and disappears underwater with a SPLASH. SMEAGOL leaning over the BOAT CONCERNED. DEAGOL is towed to the RIVER BED by a LARGE FISH he suddenly lets go of the line eyes fixed on a SHINING GOLD RING, lying in 'the SILT. DEAGOL climbs out of the WATER, onto the RIVER BANK. the RING revealed in DEAGOL'S PALM. SMEAGOL peers over his shoulder the GOLD reflects in SMEAGOL'S EYES. The HUM of the RING growing LOUDER. DEAGOL turns to look at him, a smirk on his face. SMEAGOL moves towards DEAGOL. SMEAGOL jumps on DEAGOL STRANGLING HIM. SMEAGOL rips the GLITTERING RING from DEAGOL'S LIMP HAND. SMEAGOL slips the RING onto his FINGER and DISAPPEARS. SMEAGOL descending into madness. His body TWISTS and DISTORTS he becomes a CREEPY, SHRIVELLED wretch finally crawling into a DARK CAVE beneath the MISTY MOUNTAINS. GOLLUM in the CAVE staring at the RING in his hand. A GRIM LANDSCAPE, covered in THORN BUSHES and the scars of RECENT FIRES. The DARK MORGUL VALLEY disappears up towards the MOUNTAINS. FRODO and SAM in a FILTHY CULVERT. SAM twitches in a RESTLESS SLEEP. But FRODO is awake His hand trails down to the CHAIN around his NECK. A SUDDEN HISS. FRODO quickly hides the RING as GOLLUM peers at them with GLEAMING EYES. SAM STIRS, looks at FRODO. FRODO shakes his HEAD. The GROUND suddenly QUIVERS, as a ROLLING, RUMBLING NOISE ECHOES down the VALLEY. SAM shoots GOLLUM a HOSTILE LOOK and turns back to rummage in his KNAPSACK. He holds up a piece of dried LEMBAS BREAD to FRODO. FRODO looksa t SAM questioningly. FRODO says nothing. FRODO and SAM follow GOLLUM as he leads them on the wining, torturous path clambering through BRACKEN and over JAGGED ROCKS. GANDALF leads ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, THEODEN and GIMLI through dark woodland. The MOVING FOREST of FANGORN opens before them creating an AVENUE of TREES, which allows them access along the old ISENGARD ROAD. A THICK, HUMID MIST fills the forest. The FOEST SEPARATES ahead, REVEALING the RUINS of ISENGARD. All about, the GREAT STONE WALL is cracked and splintered into countless jagged shards. TWO SMALL HOBBITS are sitting on the SMASHED WALL MERRY and PIPPIN. SPREAD before them is a feast of BREADS, MEATS and WINE. They PUFF on long pipes as they lie back in the SUN. MERRY cuts PIPPIN off before he can respond in kind. GANDALF, ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI stare at the SIGHT before them. GANDALF leads the company through the flotsam and jetsam which floats upon the muddied waters surrounding the TOWER TREEBEARD, the GIANT ENT, strides towards them, ALARMING all but GANDALF. GANDALF stares up the long length of the DARK TOWER. THE OLD ENT nods his head wisely. PIPPIN, his eye caught by something lying in the WATER The MUDDY waters GLOWING wit a golden light. ARAGORN turns as, quick as a FLASH, PIPPIN has jumped off his ho rse an d pi cke d u p -- th e PA LAN TIR . PIPPIN doesn't move, his eyes staring in wonder at the smooth black stone. RELUCTANTLY, PIPPIN hands the PALANTIR to GANDALF who immediately smothers it in his cloak. GANDALF looks back at PIPPIN troubled. BACK SHOT - a GROUP OF RIDERS gallop towards the ROHAN CITY of EDORAS. EOWYN standing alone outside the GOLDEN HALL, waiting. A ROARING FIRE a LAMB ROASTING on SPI LONG TABLES laden with FOOD BARRELS of WINE a banquet is-laid ready for the returning soldiers. Amidst the cheering crowd, EOWYN moves towards ARAGORN As she proffers the CHALICE their eyes meet. EOWYN looks at her UNCLE, as THEODEN follows her gaze. EOWYN looks at him questioningly, disturbed'by his tone. EOWYN watches concerned as her UNCLE moves away. MERRY and PIPPIN are in full voice, on top of one of the TABLES both hold very large mugs of ALE in their hands. GANDALF laughing and clapping the HOBBITS. ARAGORN steps up beside him, SMILING at the floorshow. GANDALF turns quickly to ARAGORN. GANDALF watches his friend's face seeking reassurance. FRODO and SAM lie asleep amidst scrubby bushes near a stagnant pool. SMEAGOL lies nearby, muttering in his sleep. SMEAGOL wakes suddenly, shaking, his face drenched in SWEAT, eyes wide in horror. SMEAGOL'S features suddenly transform into the MALEVOLENT face of GOLLUM. SMEAGOL casts a quick glance over his SHOULDER to the SLEEPING figures of FRODO and SAM as he clambers off his ROCK silently sidling towards the EDGE of a STAGNANT POOL. SMEAGOL stares into the MURKY depths of the WATER. The SURFACE RIPPLES as the face of GOLLUM appears as SMEAGOL'S REFLECTION. SMEAGOL choking DEAGOL Fingers locked tight around his THROAT. SAM his EYES flicker OPEN. SUDDEN SAM image mirrored in the water as he SMACKS GOLLUM on the HEAD with his POT. SAM drops the POT and FLINGS himself ON TOP of GOLLUM. GOLLUM SCREAMS his ARMS and LEGS FLAILING WILDLY. FRODO staggers over to SAM and PULLS HIM OFF GOLLUM. GOLLUM, huddled on the ground WHIMPERING and SOBBING. SAM makes for SMEAGOL again with a look of MURDEROUS RAGE. FRODO grabs SAM'S ARM. SAM pulls away from FRODO. SAM stares at FRODO at a loss. SAM, his face softening. FRODO beckons to GOLLUM. GOLLUM turns slowly, staring at SAM through hooded, HATE-FILLED EYES and SMILES. ARAGORN joins LEGOLAS on the STEPS to the GOLDEN HALL, oblivious to the CHILL WIND they look out across the SLEEPING CITY to the LOOMING MOUNTAIN RANGE BEYOND -. DARK CLOUDS mark the sky. LEGOLAS looks at ARAGORN realisation in his face. PIPPIN he is AWAKE. He sits up ANXIOUS, FIDGETY. Suddenly he hops out of bed and creeps towards the SLEEPING FORM of GANDALF. A sleeping GANDALF lies with eyes wide open. But PIPPIN is undeterred. MERRY sits up, a worried look on his face. With quick stealth, PIPPIN lifts the WRAPPED PALANTIR from GANDALF'S grasp. PIPPIN unwraps the PALANTIR and as MERRY looks on HORRIFIED, he gazes INTENTLY into it. As PIPPIN lays his hands on the CRYSTAL, a SICKLY PALE light slowly spreads from the GLASS BALL onto PIPPIN'S FACE his EYES WIDEN. On the STEPS of the GOLDEN HALL, LEGOLAS turns to ARAGORN PIPPIN suddenly starts to HYPERVENTILATE He STAGGERS BACKWARDS, PALANTIR held rigidly before him. THE GREAT EYE OF SAURON seems to LEAP from the FIRE PIPPIN is bathed in the FIERY RED LIGHT. PIPPIN sinks to his KNEES, his mouth open in a soundless SCREAM He FALLS BACKWARDS, powerless to release the FIERY GLOBE. GANDALF wakes with a start. Just as ARAGORN enters, and wrenches the PALANTIR from PIPPIN'S HANDS PIPPIN FALLS to the FLOOR ARAGORN spins away, reeling backwards, the PALANTIR falling from his HANDS. The PALANTIR rolls across the FLOOR, causing EVERYONE in the room to COWER BACK. GANDALF lifts the HOBBIT'S SLUMPED HEAD. PIPPIN is trembling GANDALF calms him. A lone white tree silhouetted by flames. GANDALF stares at PIPPIN with a FRIGHTENING INTENSITY. THEODEN stands in the GOLDEN HALL, gravely listening to GANDALF ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI look on. GANDALF looks from on to the other of the, gathered company. The WIZARD turns towards ARAGORN. THEODEN listens intently, saying nothing. ARAGORN he knows GANDALF SPEAKS THE TRUTH. GANDALF rounds on THEODEN. THEODEN holds GANDALF'S gaze. ARAGORN turns to look at THEODEN. GANDALF turns on his heel and stares at a surpirsed PIPPIN. GANDALF hurries along the STREETS PIPPIN and MERRY run alongside trying to KEEP UP. PIPPIN catches up to MERRY. MERRY turns away. This is too much for MERRY. He turns on PIPPIN. PIPPIN'S face as MERRY strides away. PIPPIN is dumped unceremoniously onto the back of SHADOWFAX as GANDALF hurriedly prepares to leave. MERRY thrusts a SMALL PACKAGE into PIPPIN'S HAND. PIPPIN stares down at the leather-bound bundle of PIPE-WEED. A WORRIED MERRY exchanges glances with GANDALF. GANDALF mounts SHADOWFAX. SHADOWFAX thunders out of the STABLES. MERRY'S devastated face. SHADOWFAX carried GANDALF and PIPPIN out of the GATE and down the WINDING ROAD towards the PLAINS QF ROHAN. MERRY clambers up a WATCHTOWER, ARAGORN in pursuit. The SMALL FIGURE as he watches his best friend DISAPPEAR into the DISTANCE. ARAGORN he knows what it is to lose someone. ARWEN - escorted by a SMALL ENTOURAGE of ELVES - rides through the gathering darkness of a PINE FOREST. As ARWEN rides through the FOREST the FIGURE of a SMALL BOY of about 5 SUDDENLY runs across the path in front of her. The BOY now stands within a VISION of the majestic architecture of the great Gondorian city of MINAS TIRITH. A SILHOUETTED FIGURE appears in the distance and moves towards the CHILD the BOY runs to the FIGURE. ARWEN watches as the FIGURE holds out its arms - swinging the LAUGHING CHILD into the AIR. The figure turns to reveal ARAGORN, a little older, dressed in the casual finery of a GONDORIAN NOBLE. The'CHILD, now in ARAGORN'S ARMS looks directly at ARWEN it is a QUIET LOOK filled with INFINITE SADNESS. ARWEN'S eyes drop to the CHILD'S CHEST around the CHILD'S neck hangs the EVENSTAR. ARWEN as she realizes she is staring at a future that can never be, the CHILD she and ARAGORN will never have. ELROND speaking to his daughter. ARWEN shuts her eyes when she opens them again the VISION is gone she is staring at DARK TREES once more. ARWEN turns towards her COMPANION who stares at her, concerned. SUDD ENLY ARWEN wheels ASFAL OTH ar ound riding away. ARWEN'S HORSE gallops over the BRIDGE and through the GATES into RIVENDELL. ELROND seated alone ARWEN runs up the STEPS towards him. ELROND stands - stunned. ,, ARWEN breathing hard, walking towards ELROND with a fierce light in her eyes. ELROND his face grim. ' . Her father turns away. ARWEN gently takes her FATHER'S face in her hands and turns him toward her. INSERT A HOODED FIGURE ascends a CURVED STAIRCASE towards a GALLERY The FIGURE stops before a STATUE that holds the BROKEN SHARDS of an ancient sword in its arms. INSERT The BLADE shattering in several fragments as ISLIDUR brandishes NARSIL at SAURON. The HOODED FIGURE looks up into the sorrowful face of the STATUE The figure is ARWEN. ELROND stares at his daughter, unwavering. ELROND turns away. ARWEN in ANGUISH, sits on her bed, the book falls to the FLOOR. ELROND picks up her JOURNAL and takes one of her hands in his. ELROND'S despair is plain. ELROND, he understands now that to protect his dauther, he must trust her. INSERT A BROKEN SWORD GLOWS with RED HEAT It's BLADE in SEVERAL FRAGMENTS. A HEAVY HAMMER pounds the RED-HOT BLADE on an ANVIL As ELVEN-SMITHS TEMPER the STEEL. ELROND'S FACE lit by FLICKERING FIRE as SPARKS fly in. the RIVENDELL FORGE. The SWORD is withdrawn from a POOL OF STEAMING WATER LIGHT SHIMMERS as the WATER DROPS slide down the BLADE of NARSIL, the SWORD that was broken has been remade. PIPPIN asleep GANDALF'S PROTECTIVE ARM around him. as SHADOWFAX THUNDERS through the NIGHT. SHADOWFAX powers along the COUNTRYSIDE. PIPPIN, huddled in front of GANDALF, the WIND sailing through his hair. SHADOWFAX gallops up onto a LOW RIDGE. Before them is the DARK MASS of Mount Mindolluin, its tall WHITE FACE whitening in the RISING SUN. Upon its out- thrust knee is the Guarded City MINAS TIRITH. With SEVEN WALLS OF WHITE STONE, so strong and old that it seems to have been not built, MINAS TIRITH looks carven by giants out of the bones of the earth. Suddenly the SUN climbs over the eastern hills, and sends forth a SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT that GLEAMS against th e face of the CITY. The TOWER OF ECTHELION stands high within the topmost walls. WHITE BANNERS break and FLUTTER from the BATTLEMENTS in the morning breeze. SHADOWFAX, carrying GANDALF and PIPPIN up towards the 7th LEVEL. MINAS TIRITH is built in 7 LEVELS - each behind a CIRCULAR DEFENSIVE WALL. Each level rises - the city reaches a height of nearly 1000 FEET on its TOPMOST LEVEL. A towering BASTION of NATURAL ROCK - shaped like a sharp ship's prow - bisects the city from the 2nd LEVEL to the TOP. SHADOWFAX arrives at a GREAT CITADEL on the SUMMIT of the CITY - 1000 FEET above the PELENNOR FIELDS. GANDALF and PIPPIN dismount, leaving the GUARDS of the CITADEL to tend to SHADOWFAX. GANDALF hurries off. PIPPIN as he takes in his surroundings, his eye caught by a DEAD TREE that stands in the middle of the COURT, FOUR SOLEMN CITADEL GUARDS standing sentry around it. GANDALF leads PIPPIN across a FLAT COURT of WHITE STONES, surrounded by GREEN LAWNS towards a GREAT HALL benejath the GLEAMING TOWER. ' \ GANDALF lowers his voice, as they approach the TOWER HALL. PIPPIN, suitably chastened, nods. A LONG SOLEMN HALL with ROWS OF BLACK MARBLE PILLARS. Between the pillars stand a silent company of TALL KINGS carved in cold STONE. GANDALF strides down the HALL, with PIPPIN following obediently behind. At the FAR END, upon a DAIS OF MANY STEPS, sits a LARGE, EMPTY THRONE and on the wall behind is the IMAGE of a FLOWERING WHITE TREE set in GEMS. At the FOOT of the DAIS, in a small STONE CHAIR, sits an OLD MAN, gazing at his lap DENETHOR - the Lord Steward of CONDOR. DENETHOR does not look up as GANDALF and PIPPIN approach. DENETHOR slowly raises COLD EYES. PIPPIN remembering. INSERT BOROMIR, as URUK-HAI arrows thud into his body, he falls to his KNEES. PIPPIN starts forward unable to say nothing. PIPPIN Boromir died to save us my kinsman and me he fell, defending us from many foes. DENETHOR pain flickers in his eyes. PIPPIN drops to his knee offering DENETHOR his SWORD. DENETHOR looks at PIPPIN blankly, overcome with grief. DENETHOR gaze turns slowly on GANDALF. DENETHOR smiles at GANDALF, as if amused by something. GANDALF looks shocked, DENETHOR'S eyes NARROW. PIPPIN, horrified. GANDALF looks at Denethor closely for a moment, then turns on his heel to leave, PIPPIN follows. GANDALF and PIPPIN stride from the TOWER HALL DENETHOR slumps back into his SEAT. PIPPIN is carefully laying out a SMALL UNIFORM of the ROYAL GUARD on a bed. GANDALF STANDING QUIETLY on a BALCONY that overlooks the GREAT CITY. PIPPIN as he stares up at the vast NIGHT SKY., GANDALF watches the young HOBBIT. GANDALF joins PIPPIN as they look towards the distant, jagged MOUNTAINS of MORDOR. PIPPIN looks up at him, unnerved. GANDALF gives him a small self-deprecating smile. GANDALF and PIPPIN share a quiet moment as they stare out towards the FIERY SKY over MORDOR. INSERT GIANT MUMAKIL carrying ARMIES upon their backs INSERT CORSAIR SHIPS sail up the RIVER. GANDALF he is almost talking to himself now like a man unable to prevent a sure disaster. INSERT The BATTLE-SCARRED CITY of OSGILIATH - last bastion between MINAS TIRITH and MORDOR. GANDALF looks down at PIPPIN, he says nothing. GANDALF stares into the distance as if seeing something in his mind's eye. INSERT A TOWERING, HOODED FIGURE, DRESSED in BLACK, is being dressed in ARMOUR by attendant ORCS. GANDALF still staring intently as if facing his enemy in .person. PIPPIN looks up at GANDALF, afraid to ask. INSERT FRODO screaming as the MORGUL BLADE is driven into his SHOULDER. PIPPIN blanches at the MEMORY. FRODO and SAM clamber into a SMALL GULLY beside a ROUGH-HEWN ROAD GOLLUM CAREFULLY.peers OVER the lip of the GULLY ___ MINAS MORGUL, a MASSIVE DEAD CITY, set upon a ROCKY KNEE at the HEAD OF THE morgul valley. CORRUPT and LOATHSOME, it glows with a SICKLY LUMINOUS LIGHT - like a CORPSE CANDLE. TWO HUGE, BESTIAL STONE STATUES guard the BRIDGE that leads to the CITY. GOLLUM, FRODO and SAM hurry from their COVER scampering in the SHADOWS towards MINAS MORGUL. FRODO he LOOKS UP at the HIDEOUS STATUES. His SENSES START REELING. FRODO and SAM look AGHAST at the sight of a NARROW, NEAR- VERTICAL STAIRCASE, cut into the ROCK-FACE Directly in FRONT of the MINAS MORGUL GATES. (CO NTINUE D) SUDDENLY. FRODO staggers across the ROAD as if some FORCE, other than his own will, is at work. He lurches towards the BRIDGE towards MINAS MORGUL. SAM runs after FRODO, catching him in his arms as he STUMBLES, SAM and GOLLUM pull FRODO from the BRIDGE. FRODO falls to the GROUND. AT THAT MOMENT the GROUND QUIVERS, and a great RUMBLING NOISE rolls across the ground and ECHOES in the mountains. The cold, dull MORGUL VALLEY is suddenly VIOLENT and FIERCE, as UPRUSHING FLAME springs from MOUNT DOOM. MINAS MORGUL ANSWERS A FLARE of LIVID LIGHTNING, FORKS of BLUE FLAME, SPRING UP from the TOWER into the SULLEN CLOUD. VIOLENT FIERY FLASHES light the CLOUD above MORDOR SHARP THUNDER rolls across 40 MILES to MINAS TIRITH. PIPPIN looking on in FRIGHTENED AWE. GANDALF'S comforting HAND rests on his shoulder. SAM and GOLLUM lead FRODO to the STAIRS. ABOVE MINAS MORGUL the SKY is BRIGHT with LIGHT as the CITY, erupts. FACES of SOLDIERS and CIVILIANS of MINAS TIRITH as they watch from the PARAPETS of the CITY. FRODO and SAM sink to the ground, holding their hands against their ears, as out of the CITY comes a RENDING SCREECH SHIVERING, rising swiftly to a PIERCING PITCH beyond the range of hearing. The terrible CRY ends, falling back through a long sickening WAIL, to SILENCE. FRODO slowly RAISES HIS HEAD across the NARROW VALLEY, directly opposite the HOBBITS, the LORD OF THE NAZGUL - the WITCH KING - suddenly RISES UP out of the DEAD CITY on his FELL-BEAST. THE CAVERNOUS GATE of MINAS MORGUL swings OPEN. and. a HUGE ARMY MARCHES OUT. RANK upon RANK of ARMOUR CLAD ORCS, moving SWIFTLY and SILENTLY, pass close to FRODO and SAM in an ENDLESS STREAM of RAGGED COLUMNS. GANDALF . 75,000 ORCS MARCHING TO WAR, just below FRODO and SAM. The WITCH KING SWOOPS down the VALLEY to join the HEAD of his ARMY. He vanishes into the GLOOM - a shadow into shadow. GOLLUM peers out from his stony hiding place. GANDALF thinking, calculating. GANDALF striding BACK STREETS of the CITY so DETERMINED and PURPOSEFUL is he, that PIPPIN has to RUN to keep up. GANDALF suddenly stops and looks down at PIPPIN. GANDALF kneels down and looks at PIPPIN earnestly, his hand on PIPPIN'S shoulder. GANDALF watches as PIPPIN hurries away. An ANCIENT STONE BRIDGE which spans the RUINS of EAST and WEST OSGILIATH - a once MIGHTY GONDORIAN CITY. ITHILIEN RANGERS patrolling the BRIDGE and the RIVERBANK. WEST OSGILIATH has fallen into disrepair, but the DESOLATION of EAST OSGILIATH is more pronounced - it is held by the FORCES of MORDOR. CAMERA tracks down beneath the BRIDGE to the DARK WATERS catching a STEALTHY MOVEMENT. FARAMIR, CAPTAIN OF CONDOR, as he issues orders to his SOLDIERS. ITHILIEN RANGERS take position they are all WEATHERED, HARDENED, PROFESSIONAL SOLDIERS Watchful, ready, waiting. ON THE RIVER the BOATS quietly advance. FARAMIR and his SOLDIERS lie in wait. As the BOATS arrive HUNDREDS of ORCS race ashore. FARAMIR steps out, his SWORD drawn. A FIERCE BATTLE ensues, but FARAMIR is unable to stop the advance as HUNDREDS OF ORCS cross the WIDE BRIDGE into WEST OSGILIATH. HIGH A DIZZYING VIEW Looking down on MINAS TIRITH, 1000 FEET BELOW, as PIPPIN desperately scrambles up the ROCKY MOUNTAINSIDE. PIPPIN clambers over a ROCKY LEDGE and ducks behind a STONE WALL panting HEAVILY. TWO bored CITADEL GUARDS sit chatting passing the long hours. GANDALF as he waits tensely below. PIPPIN as he stealthily manages to POUR OIL on the WOOD and set a FLAME to it. Within SECONDS, the GREAT PYRE is alight. The GUARDS look on in TOTAL SURPRISE as the FLAMES ERUPT into the TWILIGHT SKY. GANDALF as the BEACONS burst into FLAMES His. eyes flash briefly with TRIUMPH before he hurries off. The BEACON glows BRIGHTLY on the slopes of MOUNT MINDOLLUIN, high above MINAS TIRITH. GANDALF hurries to the BATTLEMENT, looking further west along the WHITE MOUNTAINS. a bright FIRE ignites on a DISTANT MOUNTAIN PEAK. DENETHOR staring at the BEACON from the CITADEL WINDOW a look of BLACK FURY on his face. GANDALF, a strange smile plays on his face. MOVING over the WHITE MOUNTAINS as the TRAIL of GREAT FIRES slowly winds from PEAK TO PEAK. A ROCKY PEAK high above EDORAS a GREAT BEACON FIRE is IGNITED. A BELL TOLLS urgently. ARAGORN looks tensely out across the MOUNTAINS. PULL BACK ARAGORN runs towards the GOLDEN HALL. ARAGORN bursts into the GOLDEN HALL. THEODEN looks up startled. THEODEN his head lowered Slowly it rises - he looks ARAGORN in the EYE.

THEODEN striding purposefully outside, flanked by EOMER and his SOLDIERS. THEODEN strides onto the PARAPETS. THEODEN watches as below the SOLDIERS prepare. EOWYN hurriedly pulling on RIDING GLOVES, preparing to mount her HORSE. EOWYN turns and runs SMACK into ARAGORN. EOWYN deftly pulls the cover back down. She looks at ARAGORN. to reveal THEODEN stares around at the STREETS and PEOPLE of EDORAS it is as if he knows he will not see this place again. EOMER astride his horse, calls to the assembled SOLDIERS. THEODEN astride SNOWMANE, as he, EOMER, ARAGORN and MERRY and LEGOLAS and GIMLI ride out AMID a GREAT COLUMN of ROHIRRIM, THUNDERING towards DUNHARROW in the MOUNTAINS. FARAMIR and his MEN are fighting a losing BATTLE against the MORDOR invasion. OMINOUS SOUNDS of WIND RISING HUGE WINGS BEATING. SPINNING ANGLE FARAMIR looks up at the SKY ITHILIEN RANGERS are suddenly nervous, frightened A HUGE SHADOW passes overhead. A SUDDEN TERRIFYING SHRIEK rends the AIR. SOLDIERS RETREATING through the RUINS of the CITY as, high in the sky above, the NAZGUL swoop. MADRIL as he is cut down by an ORC. MADRIL his breathing quick and shallow footsteps approach. The HIDEOUSLY deformed features of GOTHMOG standing over the prone figure of the INJURED RANGER. Grabbing a spear from a nearby underling, GOTHMOG drives the shaft into MADRIL'S chest. GOTHMOG surveys the carnage with satisfaction. FARAMIR and a few survivors flee WEST OSGILIATH, desperately riding toward MINAS TIRITH in the SKY above DARK SHAPES pursue them. SUDDENLY, from on HIGH, the NAZGUL strike. TILT DOWN following the NAZGUL as it SWOOPS out of LOW- LYING, MURKY CLOUDS tossing MEN in the AIR like LIMP RAG-DOLLS. AT THAT MOMENT Across the PLAIN, a FIGURE clothed in WHITE rides towards them. From the BATTLEMENTS of MINAS TIRITH, a call "The White Rider." GANDALF as he spurs SHADOWFAX forward. PIPPIN clings tightly to the great horses MANE. FARAMIR, SWORD in hand, remains at the REAR, trying desperately to fend off the DEADLY ASSAULT. AGAIN the FELL-BEASTS DIVE low. GANDALF thunders into view, raising his STAFF. A SHAFT OF WHITE LIGHT suddenly stabs upwards. The NAZGUL SWERVES AWAY from the LIGHT, as it pierces the LOW CLOUD. For a BRIEF MOMENT, SUNLIGHT streams through the hole onto PELENNOR FIELDS The NAZGUL circle away from the SUN RAYS, swiftly spiralling higher and higher. The NAZGUL defeated, GANDALF and the RANGERS ride towards the safety of MINAS TIRITH. IORLAS runs towards the GATES, yelling. AS GANDALF pulls SHADOWFAX up. FARAMIR STEERS HIS HORSE through the CROWD towards GANDALF. FARAMIR suddenly STARES at PIPPIN. GANDALF reads the surprise in his eyes. FARAMIR shakes his head. FARAMIR NODS. GANDALF, deeply troubled. FRODO and SAM following GOLLUM up the dizzying STAIRWAY, carved into the SHEER CLIFF. The STEPS are NARROW, UNEVENLY SPACED, and many are BROKEN. They are so STEEP that FRODO and SAM climb as if on a LADDER their desperate FINGERS clinging to the STEPS ABOVE - trying not to look at the LONG BLACK FALL below them. FRODO'S foot slips and for a brief moment he is HANGING PRECARIOUSLY from the ROCK-FACE. GOLLUM peering down from ABOVE he has reached a SMALL LEDGE. GOLLUM rears back in shock tenses like a CAT, EYES WIDENING. FRODO, head bowed, trying to pull himself up. He doesn't notice GOLLUM'S HAND reaching for the RING . GOLLUM'S FINGERS closing in on the RING. SAM, still TEETERING on the PRECIPITOUS STAIRS DRAWS HIS SWORD. STARTLED, FRODO looks down at SAM, losing his footing in the process. SAM'S horrified face as. GOLLUM'S out-stretched HAND suddenly GRASPS FRODO'S ARM pulling him SAFELY onto the LEDGE. GOLLUM glares down at SAM. GOLLUM blinks, masking the MALICE of his EYES with their heavy pale lids. GOLLUM creeps CLOSE to FRODO and WHISPERS in his ear FRODO looking at SAM his hand strays to his NECK, closing tight around the RING. HIGH ABOVE OSGILIATH, the SINISTER PROFILE of the WITCH KING seated on a FELL BEAST as GOTHMOG stands, awaiting his orders. SLOWLY the WITCH KING' S HEAD turns.

DENETHOR gently raises PIPPIN'S head DENETHOR'S eyes meet FARAMIR' S. disloyalty with vengeance. DENETHOR addresses his meal. FARAMIR as he finally realises the truth. For a brief second, DENETHOR seems to hesitate, then. FARAMIR bows low to DENETHOR, then turns to leave, stops, turns back. DENETHOR continues with his meal. FARAMIR exits. HIGH above MINAS MORGUL, on the SMALL LEDGE next to the STAIRS, LIE the FIGURES of FRODO, SAM and GOLLUM. SAM watches a sleeping GOLLUM suspiciously as he desperately tries to stay awake. SLOWLY, INEVITABLY, SAM, falls asleep. GOLLUM'S EYES SNAP OPEN he sits up and quietly crawls towards SAM'S KNAPSACK. SAM breathes deeply now, heavily asleep. GOLLUM grimaces in DISTASTE as he pulls out the LEMBAS BREAD . Quietly he SPRINKLES CRUMBS over the sleeping SAM. GOLLUM as he throws the remaining LEMBAS BREAD over the cliff. SAM'S EYES flick open GOLLUM spins around, caught off guard. Too exhausted to argue, SAM turns away. SAM gently shakes FRODO'S shoulder. - SAM rummages through his KNAPSACK, looking for a bite to eat. FRODO sits up slowly. SAM stops rummaging SHOCK on his face. SAM slowly turns to GOLLUM.

SAM'S horrified face. SAM attempts to fuss around FRODO. A terrible light comes into FRODO'S eyes as he STARES into the EARNEST eyes of SAM. FRODO pushes SAM away, clutching at the RING beneath his shirt FRODO rises to his FEET, as if empowered with a frightening intense ENERGY. FRODO. SAM stares at FRODO with DISBELIEF. TEARS WELL in SAM'S eyes. TEARS spill down SAM'S cheeks as FRODO TURNS AWAY. FARAMIR leading a COLUMN of 200 KNIGHTS through the STREETS towards the CITY GATE PEOPLE are rushing forward, THROWING FLOWERS over the KNIGHTS. GANDALF hurries alongside FARAMIR'S HORSE. GANDALF reads the PAIN in FARAMIR'S eyes he calls after him, trying one more time to stop the YOUNG MAN. FARAMIR leads the 200 MOUNTED KNIGHTS through the GATES OF MINAS TIRITH and across the PELENNOR FIELDS towards the RUINS of OSGILIATH. The people of MINAS TIRITH watch from the BATTLEMENTS. FARAMIR'S KNIGHTS FAN OUT to form one straight line of 200 HORSEMEN. GOTHMOG and his MEN watch as the KNIGHTS approach. FAST PUSH IN to PIPPIN looking on as DENETHOR eats. PIPPIN'S simple, clear voice echoes through the VAST HALL. TRACKING WITH THE 200 MOUNTED KNIGHTS. GOTHMOG rises amidst the RUINS of OSGILIATH. FARAMIR'S KNIGHTS - 75 yards away - thundering towards camera. FARAMIR YELLING defiantly. FARAMIR'S 200 KNIGHTS ride straight into a BLACK WALL of FLYING ARROWS. AS ONE, the HORSES and HORSEMEN collapse into a CARTWHEELING, TUMBLING HEAP within seconds all are MOTIONLESS. FAST CUTS of SCREAMING ORCS. THROUGHOUT the above sequence DENETHOR has continued to EAT. PIPPIN finishes his bittersweet song he looks up at DENETHOR who continues as if he has not sent his son to his death. PIPPIN turns away, his SORROW etched on his YOUNG FACE. GANDALF sits quietly in a COURTYARD, alone, defeated. GREAT SIEGE TOWERS and CATAPULTS are ROLL along the REPARIED BRIDGE which spans both sides of OSGILIATH They head straight towards MINAS TIRITH. ARAGORN, THEODEN, EOMER, MERRY, LEGOLAS and GIMLI GALLOP into a VAST CAMP beneath the COVER OF TREES TEEMING with MEN, HORSES and TENTS. THEODEN acknowledges GRIMBOLD, a MARSHALL OF ROHAN, as he passes by a GROUP of SOLDIERS. THEODEN smiles grimly as he rides on. ARAGORN joins THEODEN on a BLUFF overlooking the ENCAMPMENT BELOW. THOUSANDS of MEN and HORSES. Smoke from many small CAMP-FIRES has filled the VALLEY with a TWILIGHT HAZE. ARAGORN turns to THEODEN. THEODEN realising what ARAGORN is saying - no matter the numbers he must commit to war by the morning. THEODEN nods. The HORSES whinny loudly in the distance THEODEN looks up at the MOUNTAIN which looms behind them. HORSES rearing in terror as ROHAN SOLDIERS try to quieten them. LEGOLAS and GIMLI move through the CAMP. LEGOLAS looking at a group of ROHAN SOLDIERS they sit quiet and hunched no-one speaking. LEGOLAS looking toward EOMER who is unsaddling his HORSE. GIMLI'S eyes travel to a ROW of ANCIENT STANDING STONES that mark the ENTRANCE to a ROAD leading away from the ENCAMPMENT and INTO the MOUNTAIN. ARAGORN stands before the road as though transfixed before him a HORSE whinnies and pulls at his ropes nervously. A GHOSTLY FIGURE seems to emerge from the gloom ARAGORN starts in fright as. ARAGORN stares down at the LITTLE DWARF. ARAGORN casts another look back at the ANCIENT STANDING STONES before following GIMLI. All is quiet in the ENCAMPMENT. EOWYN kneels before MERRY, adjusting his HELMET STRAP. MERRY exhales - excited and terrified in equal measure. In his EXCITEMENT, he draws his SWORD. EOWYN steps back, laughing. As EOWYN and MERRY leave the tent, EOMER and GAMLING are sitting nearby, finishing a meal EOWYN ushers MERRY off. MERRY hurries off EOMER watches the YOUNG HOBBIT leave. GAMLING stifles a laugh EOWYN turns on both of te . hm . At the PLATEAU edge, a GUARD looks down the STEEP PRECIPICE as a HORSE and RIDER move along the RIDGE. The HOODED FIGURE slowly RIDES up the NARROW ZIG- ZAG TRACK leading up to the PLATEAU. In ARAGORN'S dream ARWEN suddenly WAKES. As ARWEN lies dying, the EVENSTAR falls from her fingers At that moment, ARAGORN wakes, his SWORD quickly in his HAND A GUARD stands in the DOORWAY. ARAGORN hurries towards THEODEN'S TENT. - THEODEN looks up as ARAGORN enters. THEODEN bows slightly to the HOODED FIGURE and LEAVES, shooting ARAGORN a strange look as he goes. The FIGURE stands and pulls back the HOOD to reveal ELROND. ELROND'S face is ETCHED with PAIN. ELROND'S eyes fall to the EVENSTAR which hangs around ARAGORN'S neck. ARAGORN looks at ELROND in shock. A FLEET of BLACK SAILS moving along a SILVER RIBBON of WATER . ELROND hesitates a BEAT. A SUDDEN WIND rushes through the TENT, lifting HANGINGS, scattering MAPS, knocking over GOBLETS. As ARAGORN looks at ELROND, an IMAGE FLASHES in his MIND'S EYE The GHOSTLY FIGURE on the DIMHOLT ROAD. ARAGORN looks at ELROND in shock. ARAGORN' S eyes fall to a PLAIN BLACK SCABBARD, which ELROND draws from beneath his robes. ELROND' S long white fingers draw the hilt of a SWORD from the scabbard to reveal a ELVEN SWORD glints in the firelight. ARAGORN takes the sword staring at it in wonder. ARAGORN draws the long blade from its sheath. ELROND stares hard at ARAGORN. A HEAVY SILENCE hangs in the room. ARAGORN re-sheathes the SWORD. As ARAGORN readies BREGO for leaving EOWYN approaches her temper barely held in check. ARAGORN looks over his shoulder at her. ARAGORN looks at her sadly, not wanting to hurt her. EOWYN steps back at though STRUCK she watches stricken as ARAGORN leaves. ARAGORN leads his horse through the TENTS towards the DIMHOLT ROAD. A LIGHT FLARES ahead.of him. A SHORT FIGURE steps out of the SHADOWS PIPE in hand. ARAGORN looks at GIMLI - GRATEFUL for his COURAGE but determined to go ALONE. ARAGORN shakes his head, smiling his acceptance. ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI as they slowly ride towards the BACK of the PLATEAU Past the ANCIENT STANDING STONES that lead to the NARROW PASS. THEODEN and GAMLING watch the RETREATING FIGURES of ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI ROHAN SOLDIERS emerge from their tents, crestfallen to see ARAGORN leave. ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI disappear into the SHADOWS of the MOUNTAINS. The ROHAN SOLDIERS murmur among themselves, "What's happening?", "Where's he going?" THEODEN as he moves forward. THEODEN looks at EOWYN who stands as if turned to stone she is looking up at a LIGHTENING SKY The QUIET before the MEN depart for WAR. EOWYN turns to the KING her FACE a BLANK She speaks without emotion. THEODEN moves towards her, taking up her HAND. EOWYN slowly lifts her head. THEODEN lifts EOWYN faces to look into her EYES. ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI make their way up a. GLOOMY CANYON, shadowed by BLACK FIR TREES. The shadowed ridges of the DWIMORBERG MOUNTAIN rise BEFORE THEM. SILENCE surrounds them, there are no birds, no wind. Only the OMINOUSLY MUFFLED THUD of their horses hooves on the dank FIR- NEEDLES. ' Before them, at the ROOT OF THE MOUNTAIN, a SHEER WALL of ROCK towers. Within the walls, a creepy DARK DOOR gapes like a mouth of night. SIGNS and FIGURES are carved above its WIDE ARCH. AT THAT MOMENT A CHILL WIND seems to rush out of the DOORWAY ARAGORN stares into the BLACKNESS, his HAIR BLOWING WILDLY. The HORSES REAR and'BUCK'in terror, turning and GALLOPING AWAY. ARAGORN WALKING into the BLACKNESS. LEGOLAS quickly follows swallowed by the DARKNESS. GIMLI left ALONE He hesitates, struggling with hi FEAR. GIMLI plunges into the TUNNEL behind the OTHERS. MUCH ACTIVITY HORNS SOUND the ENTIRE CAMP is on the MOVE fires are DOUSED, TENTS pulled down, HORSES saddled. THEODEN strides through the CAMP, EOMER at his SIDE. MERRY preparing a LITTLE PONY with a SADDLE and SUPPLIES. He is wearing an OVERSIZED HELMET and ROHIRRIM CLOTHING he looks at once NERVOUS and EXCITED. KING THEODEN breaks away from a COLUMN and rides up to MERRY. KING THEODEN wheels his HORSE away. MERRY is bitterly DISAPPOINTED. He stands, head down - a TINY DEJECTED FIGURE - as the MIGHTY ROHIRRIM on their LARGE HORSES ride by a jangling sea of HELMETS, SHIELDS and BANNERS. SUDDENLY MERRY is plucked off the ground. A SOLDIER has snatched him by the collar and plonked him down on their SADDLE. MERRY twists around, looking up at the SOLDIER Beneath a HELMET and MAIL HOOD is. EOWYN, disguised as a MAN. MERRY'S face visible under the CAPE looking EXCITED. The VALLEY FLOOR as THOUSANDS of HORSEMEN ride out after their KING. GREAT SIEGE TOWERS and CATAPULTS are ROLLING across the PELENNOR FIELDS Thousands of FLAMING TORCHES light the snarling, slathering MORGUL ORCS marching in RAGGED RANKS. Flowing torrents of ORCS stream past CAVE TROLLS, beating the DRUMS OF WAR MINAS TIRITH lies ahead - only TWO MILES AWAY. ARAGORN leads LEGOLAS and GIMLI into a WIDE CAVERN he WAVES HIS TORCH through the DARKNESS ILLUMINATING a HUGE, CAVERN. A ghastly CRACKING NOISE, like stone being sundered, cuts through the SILENCE. ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI look on in HORROR, as a MUMMIFIED SPECTRE looms before them EYELESS SOCKETS ROTTEN TEETH a pale SICKLY GLOW the KING OF THE DEAD. FOG SWIRLS around as the GHOST SNARLS at ARAGORN. ARAGORN moves forward unflinching. The KING OF THE DEAD's'MALEVOLENT LAUGH echoes through the CVS AE The FOG suddenly ROLLS BACK, forming a retreating wall of GREY VAPOUR slowly, RANK upon RANK of SPECTRAL WARRIORSare revealed. GHOULISH FACES RUSTING WEAPONS TATTERED BANNERS. The FOG reveals a DEAD ARMY of MANY THOUSANDS assembled around the CAVERN. ARAGORN stares GRIMLY at the KING OF THE DEAD. THE KING of the DEAD as he smiles evilly at ARAGORN ARAGORN holds his GAZE. THE KING of the DEAD moves relentlessly towards ARAGORN. ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI are now surrounded by~an ".' ARMY of the DEAD. LEGOLAS fires an ARROW at the KING OF THE DEAD it PASSES STRAIGHT THROUGH. The KING OF THE DEAD SNARLS and raises his DEADLY SWORD above ARAGORN' S HEAD. ARAGORN RAISES ANDURIL. With a TERRIFYING SHRIEK, THE KING of the DEAD SWEEPS his SWORD towards ARAGORN' S HEAD. ARAGORN raises 'his SWORD in ANSWER a LOW WHISTLE as it SWEEPS through the AIR. CLANG. The BLADE OF ANDURIL clashes with the SPECTRAL SWORD the SHARP RING of METAL reverberates through the CAVERNS . THE KING of the DEAD stares at ARAGORN in DISBELIEF. ARAGORN grabs the SHOCKED GHOST by the NECK. ARAGORN holds the SHARP BLADE against the GHOST'S THROAT. SILENCE. ARAGORN releases the KING OF THE DEAD he ADDRESSES the GHOST ARMY. GHOSTLY FACES stare hollow-eyed at ARAGORN. SILENCE. THOUSANDS of ORCS continue moving relentlessly forward Towards the WALLS of MINAS TIRITH. A GUARD yells down from the PARAPET above the HUGE WOODEN GATE. The HUGE GATE swings open, revealing FARAMIR'S badly wounded HORSE dragging FARAMIR behind. Both the HORSE and FARAMIR are impaled with ORC ARROWS. As CATAPULTS are prepared GOTHMOG rides through the ranks of ORCS. IORLAS and OTHER SOLDIERS arrive at the CITADEL with FARAMIR'S UNCONSCIOUS BODY on a STRETCHER PIPPIN follows them. . he runs DENETHOR EMERGES from the TOWER HALL . towards his son. DENETHOR bends to the STRETCHER bearing his SON. PIPPIN, devastated. GOTHMOG turns to his LIEUTENANTS. At his ORDERS, the GREAT CATAPULTS fire THWAT. THWAT. THWAT. The ORC CATAPULTS do not fire rocks. HORROR sweeps through the streets of MINAS TIRITH as the SEVERED HEADS of FARAMIR'S HORSEMEN land amongst the SOLDIERS. DENETHOR looks down at FARAMIR'S UNCONSCIOUS BODY. PIPPIN has run to FARAMIR and bends towards him. DENETHOR slowly turning away walking as if in a TRANCE. DENETHOR has reached the edge of the COURTYARD he STARES in SHOCKED DISBELIEF at the VISTA spread out BELOW A FULL VIEW of the ORC ARMY from the TOP of MINAS'TIRITH. 75,000 ORCS are spread out across the PELENNOR FIELDS like a sea of black ANTS. TROLLS load the CATAPULTS with ROCKS. BATTERING RAMS and SIEGE TOWERS are hauled on CHAINS. Thousands of flickering TORCHES give the army the look of a moving city in the MURKY MORDOR TWILIGHT. DENETHOR struggling to regain the power of speech. A HUGE BOULDER smashes into the wall of MINAS TIRITH. BOULDERS HURTLE from CATAPULTS across the fields towards MINAS TIRITH. A BOULDER smashes into a BALCONY full of CIVILIANS. CONFUSION and PANIC spreads amongst the SOLDIERS. PIPPIN, SHOCKED. SUDDENLY THWACK. GANDALF'S STAFF smashes into the back of DENETHOR'S HEAD. GANDALF grimly swings his staff again, CLUBBING DENETHOR to the GROUND. GANDALF GALLOPS down the WINDING LABYRINTHINE STREETS on SHADOWFAX against the flow of FLEEING SOLDIERS. SHADOWFAX bounds up STAIRS onto the LEVEL ONE BATTLEMENTS GANDALF looks at the approaching ORC ARMY, now less than 50 yards from the WALLS of the CITY. MIGHTY WOODEN CATAPULTS positioned within the walls of MINAS TIRITH are fired. THWAT. THWAT. THWAT. CATAPULTS send their great ROCKS high into the air, over the BATTLEMENTS. Dizzying AERIAL SHOTS of huge BOULDERS flying up close to CAMERA then falling away towards the ORCS. CRUNCH BOULDERS flatten ORCS. THWAT 100 more ROCKS THWAT another 1 0 0 The ORC FRONT RANKS are in disarray. As the great bloulders land among them the Orc start to panic. GANDALF walks the BATTLEMENTS as the huge BOULDERS rain onto the ORC ARMY below. GOTHMOG glances up at a WHISTLING SOUND - a huge BOULDER hurtles towards him. He side-steps CALMLY out of the way spitting on the BOULDER in CONTEMPT. SUDDENLY. 9 NAZGUL DIVE out of the DIM SKY, CLAD in BATTLE ARMOUR. SOLDIERS throw themselves down as the NAZGUL zoom overhead, emitting their PIERCING SHRIEKS. GONDORIAN SOLDIERS run for SHELTER in PANIC, covering their ears. PIPPIN COWERING. MIGHTY WOODEN CATAPULTS positioned within the walls of MINAS TIRITH are fired. The NAZGUL circle LOW over the CITY, like VULTURES seeking doomed men's flesh. SOLDIERS are plucked into the AIR by SHRIEKING NAZGUL and dropped to their DEATHS hundreds of FEET BELOW. TOWERS and BUILDINGS are DESTROYED. CHAOS as SOLDIERS, WOMEN and CHILDREN DODGE falling MASONRY. TOO LATE. The TOWERS reach the walls, their DOORS crashing down, releasing ORCS directly onto the LOWER LEVELS. As the ORC swarm from the TOWER, GANDALF realises PIPPIN has come down from the CITADEL. PIPPIN looks on stunned, as a HUGE ORC leaps towards him GANDALF intercepts the BEAST, striking him with his STAFF. GANDALF welds his STAFF, cutting through the attacking ORC with EASE BEHIND him, an ORC prepares to cut down GANDALF PIPPIN instinctively slashes his SWORD at him. GANDALF turns on PIPPIN, smiling despite himself. Out of BLACK SWIRLING BATTLE. SMOKE crawls an IRON MONSTER. A MASSIVE WHEELED BATTERING RAM . 60 FEET HIGH and 150 FEET LONG pushed by 20 huge MOUNTAIN TROLLS a MASSIVE IRON HEAD, cast in the likeness of a SNARLING WOLF. this is GROND the BATTERING RAM FROM HELL. The Ore are chanting as the BEAST is wheeled closer and closer to the GATES. GANDALF blanching at the sight of this crawling IRON MONSTER"'. GOLLUM leads FRODO up a LONG RAVINE between COLUMNS of TORN and WEATHERED ROCK. AHEAD is a GREAT GREY WALL, a last huge mass of mountain- stone and in the SHADOWS at the base of the TOWERING ROCK lies a TUNNEL. FRODO reacts to the FOUL STENCH coming out of the BLACK HOLE. SMEAGOL sensing his PLAN unravelling. Everything depends on FRODO going inside the TUNNEL FRODO stares into the darkness. GOLLUM, his sparse oily hair hanging like rank weed over his hooded eyes. Drawing a DEEP BREATH, FRODO follows GOLLUM into the TUNNEL. FRODO nearly GAGS They continue on, deep into the DARK TUNNEL FRODO is feeling his way in the dark, following the SOUND ,of GOLLUM'S scampering , ,. FRODO follows the sound of GOLLUM's voice. He is VERY TIRED. FRODO cannot see GOLLUM in the MURKY TUNNEL. GOLLUM is nowhere to be seen only his voice echoes back down the LABYRINTH of TUNNELS. FRODO FREEZES. NO ANSWER, no echo, not even a tremor in the air. FRODO realises with HORROR that GOLLUM has deserted him. FRODO breathing hard passing all manner of creatures, trussed up in evil WEB-LIKE material. A BUBBLING HISS can be heard There is a CREAKING as some great JOINTED THING moves with slow purpose in the DARK. FRODO begins to run in BLIND PANIC. SAM stumbles blindly down the ANCIENT STAIRS, reckless and uncaring, his face pale and devastated. SAM'S FOOT slips. SUDDENLY, as if the ground has given way beneath him, SAM is slipping and sliding dangerously OUT OF CONTROL. SAM thudding into a LARGE ROCK, which saves him. from tumbling headlong over the PRECIPICE. Something catches SAM'S EYE he stares, barely breathing. A package of LEMBAS BREAD. SAM looking BACK UP the LONG STEEP STAIR. FRODO is running BLINDLY He falls, trapped in the sticky substance which CLINGS to him. As he lays on the ground, unable to move, a VOICE comes to him as if froma distant-,, memory. FRODO fumbles in his JACKET, FEAR growing in him he pulls out the GLASS PHIAL - his GIFT from GALADRIEL - he holds it aloft. The PHIAL flickers kindles into a SILVER FLAME - a BRIGHT RADIANT STARLIGHT. SHELOB the SPIDER HISSES at the LIGHT. TWO great clusters of many-windowed EYES protrude from her bulbous head. Her LEGS are bent, with a 12 FOOT SPAN and HAIRS that stick out like steel spines. Her HUGE, SWOLLEN BODY, a vast bloated bag, sways and sags between her legs. Her age-old BLACK HIDE is knobbly and pitted, blotchy with LIVID MARKS but her belly underneath is PALE and LUMINOUS. SHELOB beats the air with her FORELEGS. Calling up all his remaining STRENGTH and RESOLUTION, FRODO forces his LEGS to MOVE he backs away - keeping his EYES on SHELOB. SHELOB crawls SLOWLY towards him then, with sudden . hideous SPEED, she ATTACKS. She lashes out with her FRONT LEGS FRODO is flung back the GLASS PHIAL clatters to the TUNNEL FLOOR, casting an eerie LOW LIGHT. SHELOB squats above FRODO, her EYE CLUSTERS fidgeting with hideous delight, gloating over a prey trapped beyond all hope of escape. SUDDENLY. FRODO draws STING. He slashes wildly at the GIANT SPIDER hewing off the TIP of A LEG. SHELOB SPASMS a WILD BLUR of thrashing LEGS. FRODO leaps to his feet and RUNS - not even pausing to pick up the PHIAL of LIGHT. with FRODO as he careers blindly down NARROW TUNNELS, gasping in the CHOKING AIR looking back over his shoulder for any sign of SHELOB. FRODO sees the TUNNEL EXIT ahead. just as he runs straight into a great COBWEB. GOLLUM on the other side of the WEB. FRODO as he SLASHES WILDLY with STING. The SHINING BLADE of STING as it hacks through the FIBROUS STRANDS. They whip and snap back into FRODO'S FACE as he cuts himself free. Back up the TUNNEL - lit by the LIGHT OF GALADRIEL - SHELOB'S HEAVING SHADOW approaches. GOLLUM watches in mounting disbelief as STING slashes through the WEB DISBELIEF turns to FEAR as SHELOB gets closer and closer, GOLLUM quickly turns and BOLTS. FRODO hacks at the WEB and with a last desperate LUNGE, frees himself STING is caught in the WEB FRODO leaves the SWORD and THROWS HIMSELF through a narrow CREVICE. FRODO stumbles out of SHELOB'S LAIR Tumbling onto COLD ROCK. FRODO covered in COBWEBS, wild-eyed and drenched in SWEAT - H e looks up as GOLLUM lunges at him. GOLLUM and FRODO fight Rolling on the GROUND towards the EDGE of a PRECIPICE. FRODO'S fingers squeeze tighter around GOLLUM'S THROAT. FRODO has a sudden moment of SELF REALISATION and releases GOLLUM, horrified at his VIOLENCE. GOLLUM cowering back COUGHING and SPLUTTERING. FRODO looking at SMEAGOL, in SHOCK, he gets to his FEET. SMEAGOL stares at FRODO in DISBELIEF in a FURY he LUNGES at FRODO who falls backwards, dangerously close to the edge of the PRECIPICE - GOLLUM tumbles over FRODO's BODY and FALLS to the bottom of the RAVINE. FRODO, overcome with EXHAUSTION, stumbles down the steep stairs of CIRITH UNGOL He is full of REMORSE at his TREATMENT of SAM. FRODO falls t o his knees -- FRODO lands on SOFT GREEN GRASS. SUN DRENCHED Of trees of fields of LOTHLORIEN HAZY GALADRIEL walking towards him, BARE-FOOT on the GR SS A GALADRIEL leans down towards FRODO, OFFERING her hand for a beat, FRODO stares at her torn, not wanting to go on, wanting to lie down But he knows what he must do. FRODO as he is LIFTED to HIS FEET. FRODO - once again in the dark, rank, tunnels of the PASS of CIRITH UNGOL He goes on. FLAMING MISSILES rain down on the CITY. A DEEP BOOM. GROND thuds against the MINAS TIRITH GATE sending a - VIBRATION running through the city. GANDALF, on SHADOWFAX, leads SEVERAL HUNDRED GONDORIAN FOOT SOLDIERS down through the streets. PIPPIN watches as FARAMIR'S UNCONSCIOUS BODY is carried on the STRETCHER by DENETHOR'S SERVANTS lead by DENETHOR it has the atmosphere of a FUNERAL. An IRON DOOR creaks OPEN FARAMIR'S PROCESSION enters a WIDE VAULTED CHAMBER. The LANTERN LIG HT throws great SHADOWS upon the SHROUDED WALLS of a wide VAULTED CHAMBER. ROW upon ROW of MARBLE TOMBS are visible in the DIM LIGHT. Upon each TOMB lies a SLEEPING FORM, carved in STONE, hands folded. DENETHOR speaks in a HUSHED VOICE. The SERVANTS place FARAMIR'S UNCONSCIOUS BODY on a STONE TABLE in the centre of the CHAMBER. They stand, heads bowed as MOURNERS beside a bed of death. DENETHOR turns to his SERVANTS. BOOOMM The GATE SPLINTERS under GROND'S mighty weight Behind the GATES the GONDORIAN FOOT SOLDIERS are FEARFUL. GANDALF rallies the line of BOWMEN as they wait in front of the GREAT DOORS their COURAGE wavering with each CRASHING B OW L . SUDDENLY the FEARSOME HEAD protrudes into the MINAS TIRITH. Within MOMENTS the GATE is smashed and GIANT CAVE TROLLS enter into the FIRST CIRCLE of MINAS TIRITH, under the archway that no enemy had ever passed. ROWS of ARCHERS fire off a VOLLEY of ARROWS but the TROLLS continue to SMASH the FOOT SOLDIERS with their giant CLUBS ORCS swarm through the OPENING and the PITCHED, HAND-TO- HAND BATTLE spills into FLAMES and BLACKENED, SMOULDERING BUILDINGS through the streets of MINAS TIRITH. With a ROAR, GANDALF leads a COUNTER ATTACK on SHADOWFAX, followed by SEVERAL HUNDRED GONDORIAN FOOT " " SOLDIERS. THOUSANDS OF ORCS swarm in through the CITY GATES the FIRST LEVEL is breached. FRODO STAGGERS through the PASS OF CIRITH UNGOL the weight of the RING, dragging at his neck. He MOVES FORWARD, fueled by a GRIM RESOLVE. FRODO starts climbing a STONE STAIRCASE that climbs through a NARROW PASS TALL PEAKS rise on either side, like pillars holding up a sagging sky. FRODO stays CLOSE to the ROCK WALL, masked by SHADOWS. Behind FRODO, SHELOB APPEARS. With hideous STEALTH, she follows FRODO. FRODO slowly climbing the STONE STAIRS his GAZE and CONCENTRATION on the ORC TOWER. Behind him, SHELOB lurches into a HORRIBLE SCUTTLE down the SHEER ROCK FACE. FRODO suddenly senses the LURKING MALICE he SPINS AROUND Before he can react, SHELOB VICIOUSLY STABS FRODO in the NECK with her monstrous abdominal STINGER. FRODO instantly goes LIMP SHELOB'S LEGS catch him as he around him. With falls she quickly starts WEAVING COBWEBS great dexterity, she tumbles the LITTLE HOBB IT over and over in her LEGS, binding him in WEB from HEAD to TOE. SUDDENLY The RAZOR SHARP EDGE of a SWORD comes into shot. SAMWISE GAMGEE stands before the GIANT SPIDER - STING clutched in one hand, the SHINING PHIAL in the other. SHELOB HISSES at SAM DROPPING FRODO he ROLLS down the STAIRS in his WEB COCOON. SAM moves forward, a fell light in his normally friendly eyes SAM SWINGS the small sword SLASHING upward. SAM ducks inside the arch of her LEGS and STABS STING into one of her EYE CLUSTERS. SHELOB SCREAMS, her MANDIBLES thrashing wildly, GREEN OOZE trickling from her WOUNDED EYE. With HIND LEGS, SHELOB picks SAM off the ground and TOSSES him BACKWARDS. SAM lands heavily and SHELOB POUNCES. SHELOB heaves the great bag of her BELLY high above SAM'S HEAD. As she splays her legs to drive her huge bulk down on him, SAM lifts the ELVEN BLADE above his head, holding it with TWO HANDS. STING slides into SHELOB'S SOFT UNDERBELLY. A SHUDDER runs through her. HEAVING up. again, she wrenches herself away from the PAIN her LIMBS writhing beneath her. JERKING and QUIVERING, SHELOB crawls to her HOLE, leaving a trail of GREEN-YELLOW SLIME. She SQUEEZES down the HOLE and DISAPPEARS the SOUND of her BUBBLING MISERY fades. SAM RACES TO FRODO. SAM RIPS COBWEBS away from FRODO'S HEAD his FACE is DEATHLY PALE. FRODO'S PALE, LIFELESS FACE. FRODO'S head LOLLS LIFELESSLY in SAM'S ARMS. FRODO STARING, UNMOVING. SAM lays his FACE on FRODO'S CHEST WEEPING SOFTLY. STING'S BLADE GLOWS BLUE. TRAMPING FEET approach CLINKING METAL HARSH SHOUTS. SAM looks up looks back down FRODO. SAM looks up at the ORC TOWER and then at STING which is glowing BLUE. ORCS approach - SAM must make a decision. A SMALL PARTY of ORCS and URUK-HAI heading down the STAIRS from the WATCH TOWER SHAGRAT leads the URUK-HAI, and GORBAG leads the ORCS. GORBAG spies FRODO'S BODY. GORBAG peer curiously at FRODO as he leans down and pokes at FRODO'S LIFELESS BODY. The ORCS GRUNT as they lift FRODO and CARRY him back towards the WATCH TOWER. ORC LAUGHTER FRODO is carried up the steep STAIRS  FROM the SHADOWS PIPPIN watches, aghast, as FARAMIR is lain on a FUNERAL PYRE. DENETHOR kisses FARAMIR'S sweating, FEVERED brow. BUNDLES of DRIED FIREWOOD are being stacked around FARAMIR'S BODY. DENETHOR grabs PIPPIN by the collar. He roughly carries him towards the door. DENETHOR throws PIPPIN outside. DENETHOR SLAMS the DOOR SHUT. PIPPIN RACES down the STEEP STREETS passing SOLDIERS running back from the BURNING CITY. GREAT BALLS of FIRE are hurtling through the air The city is in CHAOS. AMIDST the FLEEING SOLDIERS. GOTHMOG turns to his SECOND LIEUTENANT. As ORC run through the STREETS, MEN, WOMEN, and CHILDREN flee The PITCHED BATTLE continues. SUDDENLY. in the midst of the BATTLE, GANDALF turns SHRILL and CLEAR come the sounds of DISTANT HORNS. Off the SIDE of MOUNT MILLDOLLUIN, they dimly ECHO - WAR HORNS of the west ROHAN HAS COME. GOTHMOG turns at the sound of the DISTANT HORNS. MINAS TIRITH lies less than a MILE AWAY, down a gentle slope. Over 50,000 ORCS are swarming around the base of the city thick BLACK SMOKE belches from within it. MERRY BLANCHES with FEAR EOWYN puts a comforting hand on his shoulder. The ORCS PREPARE for BATTLE. THEODEN gallops in front of his ARMY, ISSUING URGENT ORDERS to his CAPTAINS THEODEN rides to the front of his ARMY. He rises in his stirrups, TALL and PROUD, yelling in a clear, LOUD VOICE A RAY of SUNLIGHT escapes through the BLACK CLOUDS, bathing the ROHIRRIM in GOLDEN LIGHT. WEAPONS and ARMOUR GLEAMS as 6000 HORSEMEN hold their SPEARS aloft. Below, on PELENNOR FIELD, the ORC kneel and raise their LANCES in READINESS. EOWYN, her arm around MERRY before her. MERRY looks on in SHOCK. As THEODEN rides past the ranks of SOLDIERS he runs his LANCE along their SPEARS The noise echoes through the RANKS as the WEAPONS of other RIDERS CLATTER in response. T H EO DE N f ac es hi s E NE MY . MERRY is swept up in the emotion . he whips out his LITTLE SWORD. ALL the HORNS of the ROHIRRIM burst BLAST upon BLAST. MERRY, wind blowing his hair, EOWYN'S ARM around his chest as he YELLS at the top of his lungs . GOTHMOG marshalling his troops. The first VOLLEY of ARROWS hit the ROHAN SOLDIERS The charge continues. The second VOLLEY GOTHMOG watches in HORRIFIED AWE as the ROHAN ADVANCE CONTINUES SUDDEN FEAR runs through the ORC and URUK-HAI assembled on PELENNOR FIELD The ROHAN charge like MEN POSSESSED. The WALL o f ROHIRRIM HORSES and SPEARS is seemingly unstoppable. Entire ORC COMPANIES vanish under their hooves, like sand beneath a foaming breaker, as they RACE towards the MAIN BODY of the ORC ARMY. ORC ARCHERS fire into the thundering ROHIRRIM ORC SPEARS LOWER then SUDDENLY the ROHIRRIM crash into the ORCS a nd the screen is FILLED with hacking, SLASHING SWORDS and CLASHING SHIELDS. A JAW-DROPPING SIGHT. PIPPIN rushes towards GANDALF, dodging FLAMING DEBRIS. GANDALF pulls PIPPIN onto SHADOWFAX. The ROHAN charge is decimating the ENEMY. DENETHOR standing on the table astride FARAMIR, pouring OIL over his OWN HEAD It runs through his hair and down his face, quickly soaking his ROBES. FARAMIR, his eyes flicker open. As he tries to FOCUS through his delirium, OIL splashes onto his CHEST and FACE. BUNDLES of OIL-SOAKED wood are STACKED all around them. SERVANTS are holding FLAMING TORCHES, awaiting their orders DENETHOR nods to them The SERVANTS approach the PYRE, TORCHES held firmly. AT THAT MOMENT GANDALF and PIPPIN burst into the HALLOWS, astride SHADOWFAX. The fearful SERVANTS back away from the PYRE. WHOOSH. The PYRE IGNITES. GANDALF GALLOPS toward the PYRE, knocking DENETHOR to his FEET PIPPIN LEAPS from SHADOWFAX onto the BURNING PYRE. With a desperate strength, PIPPIN pushes FARAMIR off the BURNING PYRE they tumble down the BUNDLES of WOOD, onto the FLOOR. PIPPIN douses FLAMES on FARAMIR'S clothing. DENETHOR SCREAMS with RAGE. DENETHOR leaps ACROSS THE PYRE, RIPPING and TUGGING at PIPPIN. FIRE quickly spreads up DENETHOR'S OIL-SOAKED BACK as he hauls PIPPIN off FARAMIR. SHADOWFAX rears up and STRIKES at DENETHOR who falls back onto the PYRE . DENETHOR he looks into his SON'S eyes for a BRIEF MOMENT SANITY returns. FLAMES begin to ENGULF DENETHOR. GANDALF pulls PIPPIN to safety they look in HORROR as. SUDDENLY. DENETHOR lurches off the PYRE. Now a SCREAMING, unguided BALL OF FLAME, he runs across the CHAMBER, disappearing out of the door. DENETHOR runs across the WHITE COURT atop MINAS TIRITH and PLUMMETS straight over the 700 FOOT SHEER DROP into the FLAMING CITY below. DENETHOR'S DEATH PLUNGE to the ROHIRRIM gaining the upper hand - VAST NUMBERS of ORCS are SLAIN, or are FLEEING. THEODEN STANDS PROUD in his saddle, YELLING to his ROHIRRIM. THEODEN his look of JOY turns to HORROR. " Across the VAST SEA of BATTLE come. 20 MUMAKIL. MASSIVE elephant-like CREATURES, each carrying a WAR-TOWER, packed with HARADRIM ARCHERS. ROHIRRIM RIDERS PANICKING. THEODEN on his HORSE, CIRCLING AMONGST THEM. ROHIRRIM HORSES MOVING BACK INTO LINE. ROHIRRIM RIDERS CHARGE TOWARDS THE LINE OF MUMAKIL. The MUMAKIL BELLOW as they are goaded into war, driven mercilessly by their brutal HARADRIM MASTERS. They LUMBER into the SEA of MEN, crushing RIDERS and HORSES beneath their MASSIVE FEET. Th eir SPIKED TUSKS swing wildly, sweeping and impaling RIDERS. HARADRIM ARCHERS are sending a RAIN of ARROWS into the PANICKING ROHIRRIM. EOWYN and MERRY are THROWN from their HORSE. The SIXTH LEVEL of the CITY Smoke rising around it, fires burning beneath it. A rabble of ORCS are clustered outside the SIXTH GATE as TROLLS pound on its WOODEN DOORS with HUGE HAMMERS. WOOD splinters The DOORS are near breaking point. GANDALF and PIPPIN sit on stone steps Both covered in sweat and grime, bone-weary from fighting, spirits and hearts bruised. PIPPIN looks towards the WOODEN GATES at which a NUMBER of SOLDIERS continue to build a BARRICADE. GANDALF looks at the SMALL HOBBIT a beat. GANDALF looks down to see PIPPIN looking up at him with fear in his eyes. GANDALF breaks off, lost in reverie. PIPPIN stares up at the OLD WIZARD'S FACE, softened, quiet and full of peace. BOOM. GANDALF and PIPPIN'S faces turn as the WOODEN DOORS shudder under another BLOW. The battlefield is in CHAOS as MUMAKIL decimate the VALIANT ROHIRRIM. THEODEN tries to rally his men amid the SEA of CRYING MEN and NEIGHING HORSES. SUDDENLY the WITCH-KING SWOOPS down on his NAZGUL scooping up THEODEN and his HORSE they CARTWHEEL into the AIR and land in a heap the HORSE is .DEAD THEODEN lies DYING beneath it. The WITCH-KING swooping down on his FELL-BEAST. The FELL-BEAST lands on THEODEN'S DEAD HORSE. The FELL-BEAST opens it's WICKED JAWS. A ROHAN SOLDIER stands before the BEAST it is EOWYN. The WITCH-KING laughs. The FELL-BEAST lifts EOWYN from her feet. SUDDENLY. With a mighty SWORD BLOW, the FELL-BEAST'S HEAD is SEVERED. The huge CREATURE crumples to the ground, VAST WINGS out-stretched, sending the WITCH-KING sprawling. EOWYN stands before him,the FELL-BEAST'S BLOOD dripping from her SWORD. With a shrill SHRIEK of HATRED, he knocks EOWYN backwards with his MACE. STUNNED EOWYN tries to stand and is hit once again with another CRIPPLING BLOW. The WITCH-KING laughs once again as he SMASHES his MACE downward EOWYN tries to block the BLOW but her SHIELD shatters into MANY PIECES. The WITCH-KING towers over EOWYN raising his MACE for the KILLING BLOW. an ORC COMMANDER hurrying on to the ANDUIN RIVER DOCKS, close to the CITY. LARGE BLACK SHADOWS slide across the DOCKS, as SAILING SHIPS approach O.S. A sinister BLACK SAILED SHIP GLIDES into the "DOCKS 9 OTHER CORSAIR SHIPS follow behind. The ORC COMMANDER. ARAGORN leaping from the LEADING SHIP and charging across the DOCKS, ROARING at the top of his LUNGS. He is followed by LEGOLAS and GIMLI. Surprised ORC REACTION to the THREE charging towards THOUSANDS of ORCS. The ORCS SCREAM at the SIGHT of 5000 SPECTRAL WARRIORS. The SPECTRAL WARRIORS SWARM into the flank of the QRC ARMY. With a raging blood-lust, the UNDEAD climb over the top of each other to try and reach the enemy, creating a kind of.ROLLING MOUNTAIN of GHOULS that sweep all before them away. The ORCS have no defence as their WEAPONS CANNOT MAKE CONTACT with the GHOSTS. MERRY on the ground He looks around to see THE WITCH-KING standing over EOWYN, pulling her to her FEET. MERRY driving his SWORD into the back of the WITCH- KING'S KNEE. MERRY'S SWORD bursts into FLAME and his ARM is. shot with PAIN. EOWYN struggles to her feet pulling off her HELMET EOWYN her LONG HAIR tumbling onto her shoulders. With her last strength, EOWYN thrusts her SWORD into the WITCH-KING'S FACE. EOWYN'S SWORD SHATTERS into MANY SHARDS. The WITCH-KING topples back DEAD, a BLACK OOZE leaking from his ROBES and ARMOUR. A shuddering CRY, fading into a SHRILL WAIL passes with the WIND. The MUMAKIL react with terror as SPECTRAL WARRIORS climb up their SIDES, routing the HARADRIM from their WAR-TOWERS. ORCS flee in their THOUSANDS the TERRIFIED MUMAKIL trampling them in their PANIC to ESCAPE. The ARMY OF THE DEAD swarming over the CITY, routing the ORCS. EOWYN crawls to where THEODEN lays, mortally wounded. THEODEN looks up at EOWYN his breathing shallow his vision clouded. EOWYN smiles down at him as she GENTLY STROKES his FACE. THEODEN touches her tear-stained face. THEODEN DIES EOWYN breaks down, SOBBING ALL AROUND is a VISTA OF DEFEAT. PELENNOR FIELDS strangely SILENT all ORCS have fled BATTLE DEBRIS and BODIES stretch as far as the eye can see. ABOVE MINAS TIRITH BLINDING SUN RAYS break through the LOW CLOUDS. GANDALF, LEGOLAS, GIMLI and PIPPIN watch as ARAGORN walks slowly across the FIELD OF BATTLE towards the HIDEOUS GHOULS. The ARMY OF THE DEAD slowly DISSOLVE INTO DUST, and are immediately swept away by the four winds. ARAGORN turns to GANDALF who bows his head in HOMAGE. PIPPIN running through the RUIN of the BATTLE towards a SMALL FIGURE slumped on the ground. MERRY stares unseeing at PIPPIN HORROR and SHOCK erasing all other memories from MERRY'S mind tears fall down PIPPIN'S FACE as he looks on his FRIEND. PIPPIN covers MERRY with a blanket. CAMERA RISES towards the dark ORC TOWER of CIRITH UNGOL. A light glows from the TOPMOST WINDOW. CAMERA reaches the TOWER, dissolving through the wall into. a small cold ROOM. FRODO BAGGINS is UNCONSCIOUS on the floor. His eyes suddenly flicker and he WAKES UP. ANGLE ON FRODO as he realizes that he has been STRIPPED down to his UNDERWEAR. He clutches at his throat. The RING HAS GONE. GORBAG grabs for the MITHRIL VEST. GORBAG draws his SWORD, but SHAGRAT KICKS him BACKWARDS with his foot. GORBAG FALLS THROUGH a TRAP DOOR leading to the floor below. GORBAG lands in the GUARD ROOM with a CRASH, creating SUDDEN ALARM amongst the ORCS and URUK-HAI stationed there. SHAGRAT leans through the TRAP DOOR. The DEAD URUK-HAI topples backwards over the PARAPET. landing on top of URUK-HAI and ORCS in the courtyard below. Within moments, a brutal CIVIL WAR breaks out between the TWO COMPANIES stationed in CIRITH UNGOL. SAM hurries towards the gate, fearful for FRODO. SAM is confronted with the sight of over 50 SLAUGHTERED ORC and URUK-HAI, strewn over the COURTYARD. SAM pounds UP THE STAIRCASE he suddenly PAUSES. SEVERAL URUK-HAI are running DOWN TOWARDS HIM. He grips STING and continues CHARGING UP - SCREAMING at the top of his lungs. The FOUR URUKS they see a HUGE DISTORTED SHADOW on the wall in front of them. They turn around and flee in terror back to the top of the stairs. SAM appears - and before the URUK-HAI can fully regain their wits - he slays THREE YELLING FRODO struggling against his bonds, as GORBAG climbs back into the room with VENGEANCE in his EVIL EYES. GORBAG grabs FRODO'S hair and pulls his head back, exposing his neck. He pulls out his SWORD, ready to cut FRODO'S throat. SUDDENLY. GORBAG GASPS as STING is rammed into his back by SAM. GORBAG falls dead. FRODO humbled by SAM'S unswerving loyalty. SAM quickly cuts FRODO free. SAM pulls the RING from his pocket. FRODO looks at SAM amazed his eyes drop to the RN IG SAM hesitates TENSION instantly builds between them. SAM seems strangely reluctant ON THE SOUNDTRACK to HUM of the RING builds SAM drops the RING into FRODO'S palm. FRODO sags in RELIEF he puts the RING back around his nc . ek FRODO looks at SAM, pain in his eyes. SAM looks down at FRODO his plain HOBBIT face full of compassion. SAM'S resolve hardens, a new strength takes hold. FRODO and SAM are now dressed in FOUL-LOOKING ORC gear. FRODO and SAM turn east and walk over the SUMMIT of CIRITH UNGOL into MORDOR. FRODO and SAM they STOP DEAD STARING AHEAD MOUNT DOOM 50 M,ILES AWAY - across the barren GORGOROTH PLATEAU - the mountain is erupting streams of ASH and LAVA high into the air, lighting the low cloud blanket of MORDOR with a flickering ORANGE WASH. With immense trepidation, FRODO and SAM head down the steep path into the dark kingdom. TWO TINY FIGURES in a bleak, foreboding landscape. Before them lies the PLAIN of GORGOROTH Their eyes are drawn to the OMINOUS SILHOUETTE of MOUNT DOOM. FRODO's eyes travel down towards the HUNDREDS of FIRES which glow on the PLAINS beneath them thousands upon thousands of ORCS are encamped there . THEIR eyes are drawn to a DARK LOOMING SHAPE BARAD-DUR A RED LIGHT seems to sweep across the PLAIN. SAM cannot see what FRODO sees. GENTLY, he urges FRODO on. GANDALF stands in the TOWER HALL seemingly alone he speaks quietly, doubt and fear edge his voice. He turns and crosses the HALL to reveal the presence of GIMLI, LEGOLAS, EOMER and ARAGORN. ARAGORN, his back to GANDALF. GANDALF - still troubled, still worried. GIMLI sits insolently on the SEAT of the STEWARD. GANDALF looks across at the DWARF His face ashen. ARAGORN turns around suddenly. GANDALF looks up sharply at ARAGORN. At this, GIMLI CHOKES on his pipe EOMER steps forward. GANDALF speaks in a low tone to ARAGORN. ARAGORN wearing a BREAST PLATE emblazoned with the WHITE TREE. He rides at the head of a COLUMN of 500 FOOT SOLDIERS from ROHAN and CONDOR leading them from the RUINS of OSGILIATH. GANDALF, LEGOLAS, GIMLI, EOMER, MERRY and PIPPIN ride directly behind him. AHEAD OF THEM The MOUNTAINS of MORDOR. GREAT ARMIES of ORC and URUK-HAI stream across the PLAINS from MORDOR. The VOLCANIC WASTELAND of the GORGOROTH FOOTHILLS. FRODO and SAM, still disguised in the ORC ARMOUR, slide down scree bank and land on the road below their attention is fixed on the PLAIN below thousands of ORCS can be seen marching away from MT. DOOM. FRODO and SAM moving across a HELLISH dry landscape of twisted volcanic rock and STEAMING FISSURES. 40 MILES AWAY, MOUNT DOOM rises out of the PLAIN its feet founded in ashen ruin, its huge cone rising to a great height, where its reeking head is swathed in cloud. ARAGORN'S FORCE of 500 approaches the great BLACK GATES OF MORDOR. He positions his troops about half a mile from the GATES. FRODO slumped against a ROCK he tries to DRINK from his WATER BOTTLE but finds it EMPTY. FRODO gratefully takes a SMALL SIP from SAM'S BOTTLE hands it back. A moment of EYE CONTACT between FRODO and SAM as they acknowledge what lies ahead. SAM offers FRODO his hand and PULLS HIM UP. At the BLACK GATES, ARAGORN musters his MEN. FRODO and SAM staggering across the TORTURED LANDSCAPE they are no longer WEARING the ORC ARMOUR. FRODO is walking half-bowed, often stumbling as if his eyes not longer see the way before his feet. His right HAND is pressed against his CHEST supporting a HEAVY WEIGHT. His left HAND often rises, as if to ward off some invisible blow. SAM watches him, CONCERN etched across his FACE. FRODO as a malevolent VOICE in his head calls to him "Baggins - Baggins". SAM looking behind him in time to see. A RAY of RED LIGHT stabs through the GLOOM and begins to sweep over the BARREN LANDSCAPE. SAM throws himself to the ground FRODO turns to the light, unable to stop himself. FRODO crumpling to the ground as the RED LIGHT hits him like a SEARCHLIGHT. All is QUIET No sign of the ENEMY. GANDALF watchful alert. He nods at ARAGORN. ARAGORN, GANDALF, LEGOLAS, GIMLI, EOMER, MERRY and PIPPIN galloping towards the BLACK GATES. They pull up less than 50 yards from the TOWERING GATES. FRODO is slumped on the GROUND, unable to MOVE. ARAGORN moves his HORSE forward. From behind the HUGE GATES, the terrifying CHANTING and the CLANGING of the ARMOUR of THOUSANDS. With the SOUND of TORTURED METAL, the MASSIVE GATES begin to open LEGOLAS, MERRY and EOMER look on in trepidation. With the EYE OF SAURON sweeping the PLAINS around them, SAM gets to his feet. The BLACK GATES of MORDOR SWING OPEN. SAURON'S ARMY of 300,000 ORCS MARCH OUT. ARAGORN, GANDALF, LEGOLAS, GIMLI, EOMER, MERRY and PIPPIN GALLOP back towards their SMALL ARMY as the ORC MASSES slowly MARCH toward them. Behind them, the EYE OF SAURON is directed toward THEM. FRODO'S eyes open with a START. SAM crawls toward FRODO. FRODO and SAM stagger to their feet and move off. The MASSIVE ORC ARMY marching towards ARAGORN'S MEN. ARAGORN'S MEN starting to WAVER as the ORCS ENCIRCLE THEM. SOME MEN are backing away losing their nerve. ARAGORN GALLOPS in front of his ARMY. ARAGORN he seems to fix each and everyone of his MEN with his eyes. ARAGORN holds ANDURIL ALOFT. FRODO and SAM are CLIMBING the face of MOUNT DOOM. The LANDSCAPE is VIOLENT RED HEAT hisses out of FISSURES, the ROCK is JAGGED RAZOR SHARP ASH blankets the LAND. RED LIGHTNING FORKS across the SKY with a DEAFENING CRACK. FRODO and SAM'S FEET dragging across the ASH Their PARCHED LIPS SWEATING, DUSTY FACES. FRODO TRIPS falls FACE-FIRST into the DUST SAM drops beside him. Of ARAGORN'S ARMY, totally SURROUNDED by 300,000 ORCS poised for the order to ATTACK. FRODO slowly lifts his head and looks up. FRODO'S Looking .straight up the STEEP SLOPES of MOUNT DOOM a huge mass of ash and slag and burned stone. FRODO starts to CRAWL on his HANDS and KNEES. He hauls himself a FEW PITIFUL FEET before SLUMPING in the ASH. GIMLI as he surveys the ARMY of MORDOR. GIMLI looks up into the EYES of LEGOLAS, with whom he has shared so much. The GRUFF DWARF smiles quietly. LEGOLAS drops his hand on GIMLI'S shoulder SLOWLY they turn and FACE the ENEMY TOGETHER. SAM crawls to FRODO who lies SLUMPED against the rock-face he turns him over, holding him in his ARMS. FRODO shuts his eyes, his breath coming in GASPS. With that, SAM lifts FRODO on to his shoulders and starts to CLIMB MOUNT DOOM. His plain hobbit-face grows stern, almost grim, as the will hardens in him. TWO TINY HOBBITS on the ENDLESS shale SLOPES of the MOUNTAIN. ARAGORN and COMPANY watch as they are surrounded by a tide of ORCS. ARAGORN raises ANDURIL in the BROAD SWEEP as he walks forward he turns to FACE the OTHERS. QUIET RESOLVE written on ARAGORN's face as he looks into the EYES of the remaining members of the FELLOWSHIP. ARAGORN turning, SWORD-raised, he CHARGES FORWARD. There is a moment of SILENCE no-one else moves SUDDENLY a SHOUT goes up. PIPPIN and MERRY charging forward The rest of the MEN following. ARAGORN crashing head on into a line of ORCS. The blade of ANDURIL flashing as ARAGORN HACKS at ORCS. Like a small grey insect, SAM creeps up the slope with FRODO on his back foot by foot. The mantling CLOUD swirls, revealing the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of BARAD-DUR, the Dark Tower, in the distance. SAM staggering under FRODO'S weight STRONG ash- laden WINDS are buffeting him as he slowly CLIMBS MOUNT DOOM. The PLAIN of GORGOROTH lies 1000 FEET BELOW, wrapped in fume and shadow. A TREMOR ripples through the GROUND a RED FLAME explodes into the SKY. SAM looks up - fearful the MOUNTAIN could explode at any moment. Through the THICK, FUME-LADEN AIR a set of STAIRS can be made out. SAM can't believe it - relief and joy flood through him. SMACK OUT OF NOWHERE the figure of SMEAGOL crashes into them sending SAM and FRODO sprawling. SMEAGOL pounces on FRODO his fingers wrapping around his throat, snapping FRODO'S neck from side to side. FRODO as he struggles to unlock the BONY, WHITE FINGERS around his neck but SMEAGOL'S grip is too strong. SMEAGOL'S fingers tightening around FRODO'S neck - squeezing the life out of him. FRODO comes to. The BATTLE between MEN and ORCS rages on From MORDOR, high OVERHEAD, the NAZGUL fly out into the FRAY. All the old HATRED between SAM and SMEAGOL boils over as they FIGHT SAM falls back SMEAGOL BITING at his SHOULDER. SAM pushes SMEAGOL away with his feet rolls to his KNEES, as SMEAGOL charges at him. SAM slashes out with STING. He cuts SMEAGOL across the stomach. SMEAGOL staggers back, SCREAMING with PAIN. SAM looks around desperately for FRODO. FRODO has GONE. FRODO RUNNING UP THE MOUNTAIN. FELLOWSHIP fight BRAVELY a hideous screech rends the AIR. GANDALF looks up to a NAZGUL diving straight toward him. GANDALF eyes flicker as a small MOTH flutters across his line of sight. Another cry rends the air as. SMACK. The GIANT EAGLE, GWAHIR, SMASHES into the FELLBEAST, it's claws ripping into the HIDEOUS MONSTER'S NECK. PIPPIN in the midst of BATTLE looks up. Above the BATTLE attack formation, more EAGLES appear. PIPPIN (cont'd) The Eagles are coming. The Eagles are coming. The EAGLES engage the NAZGUL.

SAM flinches against the FIERCE HEAT blasting down the TUNNEL. SAM lurches forward towards an ORANGE GLOW deep in the HEART of the MOUNTAIN. The HEAT is almost UNBEARABLE SAM sees FRODO in the DISTANCE. FRODO is standing on the EDGE of the CRACK OF DOOM a deep LAVA FILLED CHASM, in the very heart of ancient SAURON'S FORGES, the greatest in Middle-earth. The RAGING ORANGE GLARE from the CHASM turns FRODO into a BLACK SILHOUETTE standing TENSE and STILL. FRODO holds the RING in his HAND he RAISES IT, holding it over the BUBBLING LAVA far below.- FRODO a STRANGE EXPRESSION on his face. The HUM of the RING grows louder and louder. FRODO PULLS the RING close to his body as he turns to SAM. FRODO looks at SAM, the RING has finally taken him. SAM SCREAMS as. FRODO PUTS THE RING ON. He VANISHES. With a storm of wings, the NAZGUL wheel around and hurtle towards MOUNT DOOM. In the midst of the BATTLE - GANDALF realising FRODO has been seen. SAM is SCREAMING for FRODO.

Across the GREAT PLAINS - MOUNT DOOM is clearly IMPLODING. On the BATTLEFIELD, all eyes turn to MOUNT DOOM.
