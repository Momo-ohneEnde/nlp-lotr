Because    it s my birthday and I wants it. My precious. They cursed us Murderer)  Murderer  they called us. They cursed us and drove us away. Gollum  Gollum  Gollum    and we wept precious. We wept to be so alone. and cool  so nice for feet  and we only wish to catch a fish   so juicy sweet. And we forgot the taste of bread  the sound of trees and the softness of the wind. We even forgot our own name. Gandalf? Oooohhh! Frodo! Aaaahh! Gimli! My precious! Wake up!   Wake up!  Wake up sleepies! We must go  yes  we must go at once. Haven t you had any sleep Mr Frodo? And I ve gone and had too much.   It must be getting late. No  it isn t. It isn t midday yet.   The days are growing darker. Come on! Must go! No time! Not before Mr Frodo s had something to eat. No time to lose silly! Here. What about you? Oh no  I m not hungry  leastways not for lembas bread. Sam! Aragorn! Now come the days of the King. May they be blessed. This day does not belong to one man  but to all. Let us together rebuild this world  that we may share in the days of peace. Et E rello Endorenna ut lien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn  Ambar-metta! Hannon le. My friends    you bow to no-one.  And thus it was a Fourth Age of Middle Earth began. And the Fellowship of the Ring  though eternally bound by friendship and love was ended. Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf sent us on our long journey we find ourselves looking upon a familiar sight. We were home. Alright! Hey watch the pumpkin. Goodnight lads. Oh alright  but we don t have that much left. We have to be careful or we are going to run out. You go ahead and eat that Mr Frodo. I ve rationed it  there should be enough. For what? The journey home. Come Hobbitses  very close now. Very close to Mordor. No safe places here. Hurry. It s good. Definitely from the Shire.  Longbottom leaf eh? uhh huh   I feel like I m back at the Green Dragon. Mmmm   Green Dragon! A mug of ale in my hand. Putting my feet up on a settle after a hard day s work. Only    you ve never done a hard day s work. Ahaha! Welcome  my lords to Isengard! You young rascals. A merry hunt you ve led us on and now we find you feasting and   and smoking! Hmm? How do you pick up the threads of an old life? How do you go on  when in your heart you begin to understand there is no going back? There are some things that time cannot mend. Some hurts that go too deep  that have taken hold. Mr Frodo? What is it? It s been four years to the day since Weathertop Sam. It s never really healed.   There and Back Again  a Hobbits tale by Bilbo Baggins and the Lord of the Rings by Frodo Baggins. You finished it. Not quite. There s room for a little more. Bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end. That each of us must come and go in the telling. Bilbo s story was now over. There would be no more journeys for him.   save one. Tell me again lad  where are we going? To the harbour Bilbo. The elves have accorded you a special honour. A place on the last ship to leave Middle Earth. Frodo  any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine again? The one I gave you? We are sitting on a field of victory enjoying a few well earned comforts   The salted pork is particularly good. Salted pork  Hobbits! We re under orders from Treebeard who s taken over management of Isengard. Hoooom  young master Gandalf  I m glad you ve come. Wood and water  stock and stone I can master  but there is a Wizard to manage here locked in his tower   Show yourself. Be careful. Even in defeat  Saruman is dangerous. Well then let s just have his head and be done with it. No  we need him alive. We need him to talk. You have fought many wars and slain many men Theoden King and made peace afterwards. Can we not take counsel together as we once did  my old friend?Can we not have peace you and I? We shall have peace . We shall have peace when you answer for the burning of the Westfold and the children that lie dead there! We shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead against the gates of the Hornburg  are avenged! When you hang from a gibbet for the sport of your own crows  we shall have peace! Gibbets and crows! Dotard! What do you want Gandalf Grahame? Let me guess  the key of Orthanc? Or perhaps the keys of Barad D r itself? Along with the crowns of the seven Kings and the rods of the Five Wizards! Your treachery has already cost many lives. Thousands more are now at risk. But you could save them Saruman. You were deep in the enemy s counsel. I m sorry uncle. I m afraid I lost it. Oh  pity. (He sighs.) I would have like to have held it one last time. Oh! Well here is a sight I have never seen before. The power of the three rings is ended. The time has come for the dominion of men. I Aear c n ven na mar. I think I m quite ready for another adventure. Farewell my brave Hobbits.   My work is now finished.  Here at last  on the shores of the sea  comes the end of our Fellowship.   I will not say do not weep for not all tears are an evil.   It is time Frodo. What does he mean? We set out to save the Shire Sam and it has been saved  but not for me.   You don t mean that. You can t leave. The last pages are for you Sam. So you have come here for information. I have some for you.  Something festers in the heart of Middle Earth. Something that you have failed to see. But the great eye has seen it! Even now he presses his advantage. His attack will come soon.   You are all going to die! But you know this don t you Gandalf? You cannot think that this Ranger will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor. This exile  crept from the shadows will never be crowned King.  Gandalf does not hesitate to sacrifice those who are closest to him  those he professes to love! Tell me  what words of comfort did you give the Halfling before you sent him to his doom? The path that you have set him on can only lead to death. I ve heard enough! Shoot him! Stick an arrow in his gob! No! Come down Saruman and your life will be spared! Save your pity and your mercy. I have no use for it! Saruman .. your staff is broken! Grima! You need not follow him! You were not always as you are now. You were once a man of Rohan. Come down. A man of Rohan? What is the house of Rohan but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs? The victory at Helms Deep does not belong to you Theoden Horse Master. You are a lesser son of greater sires! Grima . Come down! Be free of him! Free? He will never be free! No! My dear Sam  you cannot always be torn in two.   You will have to be one and whole for many years. You have so much to enjoy and to be and to do. Your part in the story will go on. Well  I m back. I didn t think it would end this way. End? No  the journey doesn t end here. Death is just another path  one that we all must take.   The grey rain curtain of this world rolls back and all turns to silvered glass. And then you see it. What? Gandalf? See what? White shores and beyond  a far green country under a swift sunrise. Well    that s not so bad. No. No it isn t. Rally to me! To meeee! Feast on his flesh. I will kill you if you touch him. The City has fallen silent. There is no warmth left in the sun. It grows so cold. It s just the damp of the first spring rain. I do not believe this darkness will endure. Look! The Orcs  they re moving off! Get down cur! Ah! Saruman! You were deep in the enemy s counsel. Tell us what you know! You withdraw your guard and I will tell you where your doom will be decided. I will not be held prisoner here! Send word to all our allies and to every corner of Middle Earth that still stands free. The enemy moves against us. We need to know where he will strike. The filth of Saruman is washing away. Trees will come back to live here.  Young trees. Wild trees. Pippin! Bless my bark! Peregrin Took. I ll take that my lad! Quickly now! Do not come between the Nazg l and his prey. Late as usual  pirate scum.   There s knifework here needs doing. Come on you sea rats  get off your ships. There s plenty for the both of us  may be best Dwarf win! You fool! No man can kill me. Die now! I am no man! You see Mr Frodo some luck at last! Move it  you slugs! Come on! Faster! Come along you scum!   I ll whip you down to the bone! Come on! What have I told you.   Get up!   Come on you slugs! You two are going straight to the front line! Move it  come on! Fall in! Move it! Move it! Move it! To the gate you slugs  now move it!   Don t you know we re at war? Company halt! Inspection! Sam! Help me! Mr Frodo! Stand up Mr Frodo. Stand up! It s so heavy! Oh no! What do I do?   What do I do? Hit me! Hit me Sam! Start fighting! Get off of me!   Nobody pushes me you filthy maggot!   Get off of me! Retreat! The city is breached. Fall back to the second level. Get the women and children out. Get them out. Retreat. Come on  come on! Move into the city. Kill all in your path. Break it up! Break it up! Oy! I ll have your guts if you don t shut this rabble down! Go Sam. Now! Move along scum! Get back in the line you maggots! Get back in the line you slugs! I can t! I can t  I can t manage the Ring Sam. It s  it s  such a weight to carry. It s such a weight. Take them down! Fight! Fight to the last man. Fight for your lives. Gandalf!   Gandalf! Denethor has lost his mind. He s burning Faramir alive! Up! Quickly!   Go back to the abyss! Fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your master! Do you not know death when you see it  old man?   This is my hour! Gandalf! AAAAhhh!   You have failed! The world of men will fall.   We re going that way  straight as we can. There s no point carrying anything we re not sure to need. Mr Frodo  look.   There is light and beauty up there that no shadow can touch. Take mine.   There s a few drops left. There will be none left for the return journey. I don t think there will be a return journey Mr Frodo. Frodo  get down!   Hide! Frodo! Where are they? Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!   Let justice be done upon him! My master Sauron the Great bids thee welcome. Is there any in this rout with authority to treat with me? We do not come to treat with Sauron  faithless and accursed. Tell your master this. The armies of Mordor must disband. He is to depart these lands  never to return. Courage Merry. Courage for our friends. Form ranks you maggots. Form ranks. Pikes in front  archers behind. Eomer  take your Eored down the left flank Flank ready! Gamling  follow the King s banner down the centre. Grimbold! Take your company right after you pass the wall. Forth and fear no darkness!   Arise! Arise riders of Theoden. Spears shall be shaken  shields shall be splintered  a sword day  a red day ere the sun rises!! Whatever happens  stay with me. I ll look after you. Ride now  ride now! Ride! Ride for ruin and the world s ending! DEATH! DEATH! DEATH! DEATH! DEATH! DEATH! Aha! Old Greybeard! I have a token I was bidden to show thee. Frodo! Frodo! Silence! No! Silence! The Halfling was dear to thee I see. Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host. Who would ve thought one so small could endure so much pain? And he did Gandalf  he did. You may go no further. You will not enter Gondor Who are you to deny us passage? Legolas  fire a warning shot past the boson s ear. Mind your aim. Oh!   That s it  right  we warned you! Prepare to be boarded! Boarded  by you and whose army? DEATH! Forth Eorlingas! FIRE! DEEEEAAATH! CHAAAAARGE! Fire at will! Set a fire in our flesh! Stay this madness! You may triumph in the field of battle for a day  but against the power that has risen in the east  there is no victory! NOOOOOO  you will not take my son from me! NO! Aaahhh Faramir! Aaaaaahhhh! So passes Denethor  son of Ecthelion. And who is this? Isildur s heir? It takes more to make a King than a broken Elvish blade. I guess that concludes negotiations. I do not believe it. I will not. This army. In there. What is this place? Master must go inside the tunnel. Now that I m here I don t think I want to. It s the only way. Go in  or go back. I can t go back. What s that smell. Orcses  filth. Orcses come in here sometimes. Hurry! This way. Smeagol? Over here. Ah aah! Its sticky  what is it? You ll see. Oh yes  you will see. Drive them to the river.   Make safe the city.  Re-form the line! Re-form the line!  Sound the charge. Take them head-on. Chaaarge!   Cut him down!   Take the reins  pull him left.   LEFT!   Aim for the heads!   Bring it down! Bring it down! Bring it down!  Merry!   Smeagol? (shouts) SMEAGOL! SMEAGOL! Sam. Ow! And you Frodo Baggins  I give you the light of E rendil  our most beloved star.   May it be a light for you in dark places  when all other lights go out. Aiya E rendil Elenion Ancalim  Naughty little fly. Why does he cry?  Caught in a web. Soon you ll be eaten. Got away did it precious? Not this time. Not this time. NO! It wasn t us. It wasn t us.  Smeagol wouldn t hurt master. We promised. You must believe us. It was the precious. The precious made us do it. I have to destroy it Smeagol.   I have to destroy it for both our sakes. NO!   Aaaaaaaaa. I m so sorry Sam. I m so sorry. What kind of army would linger in such a place? One that is cursed. Long ago the men of the mountains swore an oath to the last King of Gondor   to come to his aid  to fight. But when the time came  when Gondor s need was dire  they fled vanishing into the darkness of the mountain. And so Isildur cursed them  never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge. Who shall call them from the grey twilight  the forgotten people? The heir of him to whom the oath they swore. From the North shall he come  need shall drive him. He shall pass the door to the Paths of the Dead. The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away. The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead   and the dead keep it. The way is shut. Brego! I do not fear death! This task was appointed to you  Frodo of the Shire. If you do not find a way  no one will. The scouts report Minas Tirith is surrounded. The lower level s in flames. Everywhere  legions of the enemy advance. Time is against us. Make ready! Take heart Merry.   It will soon be over My lady. You are fair and brave and have much to live for   and many who love you. I know it is too late to turn aside. I know there is not much point now in hoping. If I were a knight of Rohan capable of great deeds but I m not. I m a Hobbit. And I know I can t save Middle Earth. I just want to help my friends; Frodo  Sam  Pippin. More than anything I wish I could see them again. Prepare to move out! Make haste. We ride through the night. To battle To battle Back to the gate! Hurry! Well this is a thing unheard of. An elf will go underground  where a dwarf dare not. Oh. Oh  I d never hear the end of it. We must ride light and swift. It is a long road ahead and man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight. Little Hobbits do not belong in war Master Meriadoc. All my friends have gone to battle. I would be ashamed to be left behind. It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith and none of my riders can bear you as a burdon. I want to fight! I will say no more. Ride with me! My lady! Form up  move out! Form up  move out! Ride! Ride now to Gondor. What is it? What do you see? I see shapes of men and of horses. Where? Pale banners like shreds of cloud.   Spears rise like winter thickets through a shroud of mist. The dead are following. They have been summoned. The dead? Summoned? I knew that! Huh. Huh.   Very good. Very good.   Legolas! Do not look down. Who enters my domain? One who will have your allegiance. The dead do not suffer the living to pass. You will suffer me! The way is shut! It was made by those who are dead. And the dead keep it. (The Ghostly army closes around them) The way is shut! Now you must die! I summon you to fulfil your oath! None but the King of Gondor may command me! Make way for the King! Make way  the King is here My lord! Hail to you sire! I bring 500 men from the Westfold my lord. We have 300 more from Fenmarch  Theoden King. That blade was broken! It has been remade.   Fight for us and regain your honour. What say you?  What say you? Ach! You waste your time Aragorn. They had no honour in life and they have none now in death. I am Isildur s heir. Fight for me and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.  What say you? You have my word! Fight and I will release you from this living death!   What say you? Stand you traitors! Out! Legolas! Run! We fight! Open the gate  quick! Quick! Hurry! Faramir! Say not that he has fallen. They were outnumbered! None survived. Fear. The city is rank with it! Ha ha ha ha. Let us ease their pain. Release the prisoners! Where are the riders from Snowbourn? None have come my lord. Six thousand spears  less than half of what I had hoped for. Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor. More will come Every hour lost hastens Gondor s defeat.   We have until dawn then we must ride. The horses are restless and the men are quiet. They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain. That road there where does that lead? It is the road to the Dimholt  the door under the mountain. Catapults!   ha ha ha. My sons are spent!   My line has ended! He s alive! The house of Stewards has failed. He needs medicine my lord! My line has ended! My lord! Rohan has deserted us! Theoden s betrayed me! ABANDON YOUR POSTS!  FLEE! FLEE FOR YOUR LIVES! Prepare for battle. Hurry men! To the wall! Defend the wall! Over here! Return to your posts. Send these foul beasts into the Abyss. Stay where you are! We need more rubble! None who venture there ever return. That mountain is evil. Aragorn!   Let s find some food. There. A true esquire of Rohan. I m ready!   Sorry. It isn t all that dangerous. It s not even sharp. To the smithy  go! You should not encourage him. You should not doubt him. I do not doubt his heart  only the reach of his arm. Why should Merry be left behind? He has as much cause to go to war as you. Why can he not fight for those he loves? You know as little of war as that Hobbit. When the fear takes him   and the blood and the screams and the horror of battle take hold. Do you think he would stand and fight? He would flee. And he would be right to do so.   War is the province of men Eowyn. Sir? King Theoden awaits you my lord. Watch out! Down to the lower levels quick! Double up men! Hold them back  do not give in to fear. Stand to your posts. Fight! Not at the towers! Aim for the trolls  kill the trolls! Bring them down! Fight them back!  Peregrin Took! Go back to the Citadel. They called us out to fight. This is no place for a Hobbit! Guard of the Citadel indeed!   Now back up the hill quickly. Quick! What are you doing you useless scum? The door wont give. It s too strong. I take my leave. My lord Elrond I come on behalf of one whom I love. Arwen is dying. She will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor. The light of the evenstar is failing. As Sauron s power grows her strength wanes. Arwen s life is now tied to the fate of the Ring. The Shadow is upon us Aragorn. The end has come. It will not be our end  but his. You ride to war but not to victory. Sauron s armies ride on Minas Tirith  this you know. But in secret he sends another force  which will attack  from the river.   A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the South. They will be in the city in two days. You re outnumbered Aragorn. You need more men. There are none. There are those that dwell in the mountain. Murderers  traitors. You would call upon them to fight? They believe in nothing. They answer to no one They will answer to the King of Gondor.   And ril  the Flame of the West  forged from the shards of Narsil. Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of Elendil. The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith. The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth. Put aside the Ranger. Become who you were born to be  nen i-Estel Edain.  -chebin Estel anim. Why are you doing this? The war lies to the East. You cannot leave on the eve of battle. You cannot abandon the men. What were you thinking Peregrin Took? What service can a Hobbit offer such a great lord of men?   It was well done. A generous deed should not be checked with cold counsel.   You are to join the tower guard. I didn t think they would find any livery that would fit me. It once belonged to a young boy of the city. A very foolish one who wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending his studies. This was yours? Yes  it was mine. My father had it made for me. Get back there and smash it down! But nothing can breach it! Grond will breach it!   Bring out the wolf s head. Grond  Grond  Grond  Grond  Grond! Grond  Grond  Grond  Grond! Eowyn  We need you here. Why have you come? Do you not know? It is but a shadow and a thought that you love. I cannot give you what you seek. I have wished you joy since first I saw you. Just where do you think you re off to? Not this time. This time you must stay Gimli. Hmmmm Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness of dwarves? You might as well accept it. We re going with you laddie. Aragorn smiles. What s happening  where is he going? I don t understand. (  Lord Aragorn! Why does he leave on the eve of battle? He leaves because there is no hope. He leaves because he must. Well  I m taller than you were then. Though  I m not likely to grow anymore  except sideways. It never fitted me either. Boromir was always the soldier.   They were so alike he and my father. Proud  stubborn even  but strong. I think you have strength of a different kind. And one day your father will see it. Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor in peace or war  in living or dying  from     from this hour henceforth until my lord release me or death take me. And I shall not forget it!   nor fail to reward that which is given.   Fealty with love.   Valour with honour. Disloyalty with vengeance.   I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defences. Defences that your brother long held intact. What would you have me do? I will not yield the River and Pellenor unfought. Osgiliath must be retaken. My lord Osgiliath is over run. Much must be risked in war. Is there a Captain here who still has the courage to do his lord s will? You wish now that our places had been exchanged. That I had died and Boromir had lived. Yes  I wish that. To few have come. We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor. No  we cannot. But we will meet them in battle nonetheless. I have left instruction.   The people are to follow your rule in my stead. Take up my seat in the Golden Hall. Long may you defend Edoras  if the battle goes ill. What other duty would you have me do my lord? Duty?   no.   I would have you smile again  not grieve for those whose time has come. You shall live to see these days renewed     and no more despair Since you are robbed of Boromir I will do what I can in his stead.   If I should return  think better of me father. That will depend on the manner of your return. Ech! What are you up to? Sneaking off are we? Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so polite. Smeagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find and they say  sneak!  Sneak? Very nice friend  oh yes my precious very nice   very nice! Alright! Alright! You just startled me is all. What were you doing? Sneaking. Fine  have it your own way.   I m sorry to wake you Mr Frodo but we have to be moving on. It s dark still. It s always dark here.   It s gone!   The elven bread! What? That s all we have left! We can t hold them. The city is lost. Tell the men to break cover. We ride for Minas Tirith. Nazg l! Take cover! Nazgul! Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith! He took it. He must have. Smeagol? No  no  not poor Smeagol. Smeagol hates nasty elf bread. You re a lying rat! What did you do with it? He doesn t eat it.   He can t have taken it. Look  what s this?   Crumbs on his jacketses. He took it!  He took it!   I ve seen him  he s always stuffing his face when master s not looking. That s a filthy lie!   You stinking  two faced sneak! Sam! Call me  Stop it! I ll kill him! Sam  no! Oh my! I m sorry. I didn t mean it to go so far. I was just so  so angry! Here just  let s just rest a bit. I m all right. No. No you re not all right  you re exhausted. It s that Gollum. It s this place. It s that thing around your neck.   I could help a bit. I could carry it for a while    carry it for a while   I could carry it  I could carry it  Share the load  share the load  share the load Get away! Fall back!   Retreat! Retreat! Run for your lives! The age of men is over. The time of the Orc has come. Keep going. It s the Nazgul. Take cover my lord.   It s coming. Its Mithrandir! The White Rider! Pull! Mithrandir!   They broke through our defences. They ve taken the bridge and the West bank. Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river. It is as the Lord Denethor predicted! Long has he foreseen this doom! Foreseen and done nothing! Faramir? This is not the first Halfling to have crossed your path. No. You ve seen Frodo and Sam? Where? When? I don t want to keep it.   I just want to help. See? See? He wants it for himself. Shut up you!   Go away! Get out of here! No Sam! It s you!   I m sorry Sam. But he s a liar! He s poisoned you against me. You can t help me any more. You don t mean that. Go home. Faramir! Faramir!   Your father s will has turned to madness. Do not throw away your life so rashly. Where does my allegiance lie if not here? This is the city of the men of N menor. I will gladly give my life to defend her beauty  her memory  her wisdom. Your father loves you Faramir.   He will remember it before the end. Can you sing Master Hobbit? well  yes. At least well enough for my own people. But we have no songs for great halls and evil times. Sauron s wrath will be terrible  his retribution swift. The battle for Helm s Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin. (looking back out to Mordor) All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits... In Ithilien. Not two days ago. Gandalf  they re taking the road to the Morgul vale. And then the pass of Cirith Ungol. What does that mean? What s wrong? He looks at Gandalf. Faramir tell me everything. Tell me all you know. This is how you would serve your city? You would risk its utter ruin? I did what I judged to be right. What you judged to be right! You sent the Ring of power into Mordor in the hands of a witless Halfling! It should have been brought back to the citadel to be kept safe. Hidden. Dark and deep in the vaults  not to be used.   unless  at the uttermost end of need. I would not use the Ring. Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin and I alone could save her. Ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious as a King of old. Boromir would have remembered his father s need. He would have brought me a kingly gift Boromir would not have brought the Ring. He would have stretched out his hand to this thing and taking it he would have fallen. And why should your songs be unfit for my halls? Come  sing me a song. Home is behind  The world ahead    And there are many paths to tread  Through shadow  to the edge of night   Until the stars are all alight.   Mist and shadow cloud and shade  All shall fade  All shall    fade. March  march! March  march march! ...somewhere in the wilderness. I wonder if we ll ever be put into songs or tales. What? I wonder if people will ever say  \"Let s hear about Frodo and the Ring.\" And they ll say  \"Yes! That s one of my favourite stories.\" \"Frodo was really courageous  wasn t he  Dad? \" \"Yes  my boy.  The most famousest of Hobbits. And that s saying a lot.\"  Well  you ve left out one of the chief characters: \"Samwise the Brave.\" I want to hear more about Sam. Frodo wouldn t have got far without Sam. Now  Mr. Frodo  you shouldn t make fun. I was being serious. So was l.   \"Samwise the Brave.\" Smeagol? We re not going to wait for you. Come on.  Master. Master looks after us.  Master wouldn t hurt us. Master broke his promise. Don t ask Smeagol. Poor  poor Smeagol. Master betrayed us. Wicked. Tricksy. False.  We ought to wring his filthy little neck. Kill him! Kill him! Kill them both!  And then we take the precious......and we be the master! You know nothing of this matter! He would have kept it for his own. And when he returned you would not have known your son. Boromir was loyal to me! Not some wizard s pupil. Father? My son!   Leave me! Careful master! Careful. Very far to fall. Very dangerous are the stairs. Come master. Come to Smeagol. Mr Frodo!   Get back you! Don t touch him. Why does he hates poor Smeagol? What has Smeagol ever done to him? Master?  Master carries a heavy burden Smeagol knows  heavy heavy burden. Fat one cannot know.   He wants it. He needs it. Smeagol sees it in his eye.   Very soon he will ask you for it. You will see. The fat one will take it from you! Send forth all legions. Do not stop the attack until the city is taken. But the fat Hobbit  he knows. Eyes always watching. Then we stabs them out. Put out his eyeses and make him crawl. Yes. Yes. Yes. Kill them both. Yes.   No! No!  It s too risky. It s too risky. Where is he? Where has he gone? Hey  Gollum! Where are you? Smeagol? We could let   do it. Yes. She could do it. Yes  precious  she could. And then we takes it once they re dead. Once they re dead.  Ssssssssssssssh! Come on  Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.   Smeagol will show you the way. Stay out of the forest! Keep away from the trees! Final count.....42. Forty-two? That s not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling. I myself am sitting pretty on 43.  Forty-three. He was already dead. Slay them all! What of the wizard? I will break him. Where are Theoden s riders? Will Rohan s army come? Mithrandir? Courage is the best defence that you have now. Follow me. He was twitching. He was twitching......because he s got my axe  embedded in his nervous system! He doesn t look too happy  does he? Not too happy at all  Merry. Still  I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there. Oh  yes. It s a quality establishment. I hear the staff are very good. What are you doing? Nothing. The world s back to normal  that s all. No  it isn t. I m starving. Good luck trying to find something decent around here.  Probably only dead rats and mouldy bread.  Saruman s storeroom! I don t believe it. It can t be. lt is! Longbottom Leaf.  The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing. It s perfect. One barrel each. Wait. Do you think we should share it with Treebeard? Share it?  No. No.  Dead plant and all that. Don t think he d understand.  Could be a distant relative. I get it. Don t be hasty. Exactly.   Bar-hrum. This is the old sewer. Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city. You ll find cover in the woods there. Captain Faramir......you have shown your quality  sir. The very highest. The Shire must truly be a great realm Master Gamgee......where gardeners are held in high honor. What road will you take once you reach the woods? Gollum says there s a path......near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.  Cirith Ungol?  ls that its name? No.  No!   Yes. Frodo......they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul. You cannot go that way. lt is the only way. Master says we must go to Mordor  so we must try. I must. Go  Frodo. Go with the goodwill of all Men.  Thank you. May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm. Come on  keep up. Mr. Frodo didn t mean for them Rangers to hurt you. You know that  don t you? He was trying to save you  see? Save me? So there s no hard feelings. Forgive and forget. No  no  no hard feelings. Gollum  Gollum.  Yes  master. Nice Hobbits. Very decent of you. Very decent  indeed Gollum. Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern shore. Their numbers are too great. By nightfall we will be overrun. Mr. Frodo? It s calling to him  Sam. His Eye is almost on me. Hold on  Mr. Frodo. You ll be all right. Take them to my father.  Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.  A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.   Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?  You want to know why your brother died? He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!  He tried to kill him! The Ring drove your brother mad! Watch out! Mr. Frodo? They re here. They ve come. Nazgul! Stay here. Keep out of sight.  Take cover! The fortress is taken. It is over.  You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it. They still defend it. They have died defending it. They are breaking in! They re past the door! Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves? Is there no other way? There is one passage. It leads into the mountains. But they will not get far. The Uruk-hai are too many. Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass. And barricade the entrance! Aragorn! Fall back to the Keep! Get your men out of there!  Nan Barad! Nan Barad!   Haldir  nan Barad! ( What are you doing? What are you stopping for? Nan Barad! (To the Keep!) Haldir! So much death.   What can Men do against such reckless hate? Ride out with me.  Ride out and meet them.  For death and glory. For Rohan. For your people. The sun is rising. Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn......Iook to the east. Yes.........Yes.........The horn of Helm Hammerhand......shall sound in the Deep......one last time. Yes!  Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.   Fell deeds  awake. Now for wrath......now for ruin and a red dawn.  Forth Eorlingas!  Gandalf. Theoden King stands alone.  Brace the gate! Hold them! To the gate. Draw your swords! Make way! (  We cannot hold much longer! Hold them! How long do you need? As long as you can give me. Gimli! Timbers! Brace the gate! Come on. We can take them. It s a long way. Toss me. Not alone.   Rohirrim! Eomer.  To the king! Yes! A hit. A fine hit. Break the dam! Release the river! Pippin! Hold on! Hold on  little Hobbits. What are you doing? Where are you going? It s me. It s your Sam. Don t you know your Sam? What? I cannot jump the distance! You ll have to toss me! Don t tell the Elf. Not a word. Shore up the door! Make way! Follow me to the barricade. Watch our backs! Throw another one over here! Higher! Hold fast the gate! Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there! Aragorn! Pull everybody back. Pull them back. Fall back! Fall back! I can t do this  Sam. I know. It s all wrong.  By rights  we shouldn t even be here. But we are. It s like in the great stories  Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered.  Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn t want to know the end.....because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was...... when so much bad had happened? Victory! We have victory! But in the end  it s only a passing thing...... this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines  it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you......that meant something. Even if you were too small to understand why. But I think  Mr. Frodo  I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories......had lots of chances of turning back  only they didn t. They kept going......because they were holding on to something. What are we holding on to  Sam? That there s some good in this world  Mr. Frodo. And it s worth fighting for. I think at last we understand one another  Frodo Baggins.   You know the laws of our country  the laws of your father. If you let them go your life will be forfeit. Then it is forfeit. Release them.  They have broken through! The castle is breached. Retreat! Fall back! Retreat! Hurry! Inside. Get them inside! Into the Keep! I will leave you at the western borders of the forest. You can make your way north to your homeland from there. Wait! Stop! Stop! Turn around. Turn around. Take us south. South? But that will lead you past lsengard. Yes. Exactly. If we go south  we can slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer we are to danger  the farther we are from harm. It s the last thing he ll expect. That doesn t make sense to me. But then......you are very small.  Perhaps you re right. South it is  then. Hold on  little Shirelings.  I always like going south. Somehow it feels like going downhill.  Are you mad? We ll be caught. No  we won t. Not this time. Look! Osgiliath burns! Mordor has come. The Ring will not save Gondor.   It has only the power to destroy. Please......Iet me go. Hurry. Faramir! You must let me go! And those little family of field mice......that climb up sometimes  and they tickle me awfully. They re always trying to get somewhere where they.... Many of these trees were my friends. Creatures I had known from nut and acorn. I m sorry  Treebeard. They had voices of their own. Saruman. A wizard should know better! There is no curse in Elvish......Entish or the tongues of Men......for this treachery. You could have picked a better spot.  Well  lad  whatever luck you live by  let s hope it lasts the night. Your friends are with you  Aragorn. Let s hope they last the night. A Eruch n   -dano i faelas a hyn an uben tanatha le faelas!   What s happening out there? Shall I describe it to you? Or would you like me to find you a box? Look! The trees! They re moving! Where are they going? They have business with the Orcs. My business is with lsengard tonight......with rock and stone. Yes! Come  my friends. The Ents are going to war. It is likely......that we go to our doom. Last march......of the Ents. So it begins. Tangado a chadad! Faeg i-varv d n na lanc a nu ranc. Leithio i philinn! Did they hit anything?  Give them a volley. Fire! Fire! Ribed bant! Send them to me! Come on!  Pendraith!   Good! Swords! Swords! Legolas! Two already! I m on 17! I ll have no pointy-ear outscoring me! Nineteen! Merry. We have just agreed.  Yes? I have told your names to the Entmoot......and we have agreed......you are not Orcs.  Well  that s good news. And what about Saruman? Have you come to a decision about him? Now  don t be hasty  Master Meriadoc. Hasty? Our friends are out there.  They need our help. They cannot fight this war on their own. War? Yes. It affects us all. Tree  root and twig. But you must understand  young Hobbit......it takes a long time......to say anything in Old Entish...  ...and we never say anything......unless it is worth taking......a long time to say.  Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty! Twenty-one! Causeway! Is this it? Is this is all you can conjure Saruman? Togo hon dad  Legolas!   Dago hon! Dago hon! Brace the gate! Hold them! Stand firm! Aragorn! Gimli! Hado i philinn! Herio! The Ents cannot hold back this storm. We must weather such things as we have always done.  How can that be your decision?! This is not our war.  But you re part of this world! Aren t you?!  You must help. Please. You must do something. You are young and brave  Master Merry. But your part in this tale is over. Go back to your home.  Maybe Treebeard s right. We don t belong here  Merry. It s too big for us. What can we do in the end? We ve got the Shire. Maybe we should go home.  The fires of lsengard will spread......and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn. And....  And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone. There won t be a Shire  Pippin. Boromir! Boromir! This city was once the jewel of our kingdom. A place of light and beauty and music. And so it shall be once more!  Let the armies of Mordor know this: Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.  This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed  for Gondor! For Gondor! For Gondor! For Gondor! For Gondor! Good speech. Nice and short. Leaves more time for drinking! Break out the ale! These men are thirsty! Remember today  little brother. Today  life is good. What? He s here. One moment of peace  can he not give us that? Where is he? Where is Gondor s finest? Where s my first-born? Father! They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly. They exaggerate. The victory belongs to Faramir also. But for Faramir  this city would still be standing. Were you not entrusted to protect it? I would have done  but our numbers were too few. Oh  too few. You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim. Always you cast a poor reflection on me. That is not my intent. You give him no credit  and yet he tries to do your will. He loves you  Father. Do not trouble me with Faramir......I know his uses  and they are few. We have more urgent things to speak of. Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting. He will not say why  but I have guessed its purpose. It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found. The One Ring. lsildur s Bane. lt has fallen into the hands of the Elves. Everyone will try to claim it: Men  Dwarves  wizards. We cannot let that happen. This thing must come to Gondor. Gondor. It s dangerous  I know. Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men. But you  you are strong. And our need is great. It is our blood which is being spilled  our people who are dying. Sauron is biding his time. He s massing fresh armies. He will return. And when he does  we will be powerless to stop him. You must go.  Bring me back this mighty gift . No. My place is here with my people.  Not in Rivendell. Would you deny your own father? lf there is need to go to Rivendell......send me in his stead. You? Oh  I see. A chance for Faramir  captain of Gondor  to show his quality. I think not.  I trust this mission only to your brother. The one who will not fail me. Remember today  little brother. Captain Faramir!  We found the third one. You must come with me. Now. Down there. To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.  They wait for my command. Shall I shoot? The rock and pool Is nice and cool So juicy sweet Our only wish To catch a fish So juicy sweet Wait. This creature is bound to me. And I to him. He is our guide. Please......Iet me go down to him. Smeagol.   Master is here. Come  Smeagol. Trust master. Come. We must go now? Smeagol  you must trust master. Follow me. Come on. Come. Come  Smeagol. Nice Smeagol. That s it. Come on. Don t hurt him!  Smeagol  don t struggle. Smeagol  listen to me. May the grace of the Valarprotect you. Brego. Arwen.  Tollen i l . I chair gwannar na Valannor. Si bado  no c rar. I have made my choice. He is not coming back.Why do you linger herewhen there is no hope? Master! That s enough.  Where are you leading them?  Answer me. Smeagol. Why does it cry  Smeagol? Cruel Men hurts us. Master tricksed us. Of course he did. I told you he was tricksy. I told you he was false. Master is our friend. Our friend. Master betrayed us. No. Not its business. Leave us alone! Filthy little Hobbitses! They stole it from us! There is still hope. If Aragorn survives this waryou will still be parted.If Sauron is defeatedand Aragorn made king......and all that you hope forcomes true......you will still have to tastethe bitterness of mortality. Whether by the swordor the slow decay of time......Aragorn will die.And there will be no comfortfor you......no comfort to ease the painof his passing.He will come to death......an image of the splendorof the kings of Men......in glory undimmed beforethe breaking of the world. But you  my daughter......you will linger on in darknessand in doubt......as nightfall in winterthat comes without a star.Here you will dwell......bound to your griefunder the fading trees...... until all the world is changed......and the long years of your lifeare utterly spent. Arwen. There is nothing for you here......only death. A im   - erin veleth l n? Gerich veleth n n  ada. I amar prestar aen... han mathon ne nen  han mathon ne chae a han noston ned  wilith. What news? Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.   Theoden s people have fled to Helm s Deep. But we must look to our own borders. Faramir  Orcs are on the move. Sauron is marshaling an army. Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate. How many? Some thousands. More come every day. Who s covering the river to the north? We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath. If their city is attacked  we won t hold it. No. No. What did they steal? My precious! We have to get out of here. You go. Go  now. You can do it. Use the Ring  Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on. Disappear. I can t. You were right  Sam. You tried to tell me but.... I m sorry. The Ring s taking me  Sam. If I put it on......he ll find me. He ll see. Mr. Frodo.... So this is the answer to all the riddles.  Here in the Wild I have you......two Halflings......and a host of men at my call. The Ring of Power within my grasp. A chance for Faramir  captain of Gondor......to show his quality. No! Stop it! Leave him alone.  Don t you understand? He s got to destroy it! That s where we re going  into Mordor. To the Mountain of Fire! Osgiliath is under attack. They call for reinforcements. Please. It s such a burden. Will you not help him? Captain? Prepare to leave.  The Ring will go to Gondor. Mae carnen  Brego  mellon n n. Saruman attacks from lsengard. Sauron from Mordor. The fight will come to Men on both fronts. Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us soon. And he will strike hard. He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him. My men tell me that you are Orc spies. Spies? Now wait just a minute. Well  if you re not spies  then who are you? Speak. We are Hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins is my name  and this is Samwise Gamgee. Your bodyguard? His gardener. And where is your skulking friend? That gangrel creature. He had an ill-favored look. There was no other.  We set out from Rivendell with seven companions. One we lost in Moria......two were my kin......a Dwarf there was also. And an Elf and two Men. Aragorn  son of Arathorn  and Boromir of Gondor. You re a friend of Boromir? Yes. For my part. He s alive! Where is he? Where is he? Get out of the way! I m going to kill him! You are the luckiest  the canniest  .....and the most reckless man I ever knew. Bless you  laddie. Gimli  where is the king? Le abdollen.  You look terrible. Hannon le. A great host  you say? All lsengard is emptied. How many? Ten thousand strong at least. Ten thousand? It is an army bred for a single purpose: To destroy the world of Men. They will be here by nightfall. Let them come! I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms......to be ready for battle by nightfall. We will cover the causeway and the gate from above. No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall......or set foot inside the Hornburg! It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead. Dead? How? When? As one of his companions  I d hoped you would tell me. If something has happened to Boromir  we would have you tell us. His horn washed up upon the riverbank  about six days past. It was cloven in two. But more than this  I know it in my heart.  He was my brother. This is no rabble of mindless Orcs. These are Uruk-hai. Their armour is thick and their shields broad. I have fought many wars  Master Dwarf. I know how to defend my own keep. They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.  Saruman s hordes will pillage and burn. We ve seen it before. Crops can be resown......homes rebuilt. Within these walls......we will outlast them. They do not come to destroy Rohan s crops or villages. They come to destroy its people......down to the last child. What would you have me do? Look at my men. Their courage hangs by a thread. If this is to be our end  then I would have them make such an end......as to be worthy of remembrance. Send out riders  my lord. You must call for aid. And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We are not so lucky in our friends as you. The old alliances are dead. Gondor will answer. ( Gondor?! Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?! Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?! Where was Gon--?  No  my Lord Aragorn......we are alone.  Get the women and children into the caves. We need more time to lay provisions-- The light of the Evenstardoes not wax and wane.It is mine to give to whom I will.Like my heart.Go to sleep. I am asleep. This is a dream. Then it is a good dream.  Sleep. Minl  pendich nin i aur hen telitha. We wants it.We needs it.Must have the precious.They stole it from us.Sneaky little Hobbitses.Wicked. Tricksy. False.

No. There is no time. War is upon us. Secure the gate. We Ents have not troubled......about the wars of Men and wizards......for a very long time. But now  something is about to happen......that has not happened......for an age. Entmoot. What s that?  Tis a gathering. A gathering of what? Beech. Oak. Chestnut. Ash. Good. Good. Good. Many have come. Now we must decide if the Ents......will go to war.   i vethed... n  i onnad. Boe bedich go Frodo. Han b d l n. Dolen i v d o nin. Si peliannen i v d na dail l n.

Give it to us raw...  ...and wriggling.You keep nasty chips. You re hopeless. Mr. Frodo? Who are they? You have some skill with a blade. Women of this country learned long ago:Those without swordscan still die upon them.I fear neither death nor pain. What do you fear  my lady? A cage.To stay behind bars until useand old age accept them.And all chance of valor has gonebeyond recall or desire. You re a daughter of kings......a shieldmaiden of Rohan.I do not think that would be your fate. Theoden will not stay at Edoras.It s vulnerable. He knows this. He will expect an attack on the city. They will flee to Helm s Deep......the great fortress of Rohan. It is a dangerous road to takethrough the mountains. They will be slow. They will have women and childrenwith them. Send out your Warg-riders. Hey  stinker  don t go gettingtoo far ahead. Why do you do that? What? Call him names.Run him down all the time. Because.Because that s what he is  Mr. Frodo.There s naught left in himbut lies and deceit.It s the Ring he wants.It s all he cares about. You have no idea what it did to him......what it s still doing to him. I want to help him  Sam. Why? What is it? What do you see? Warg! We re under attack! Get them out of here! All riders to the head of the column. Come on. Get me up here. I m a rider.Come on! You must lead the peopleto Helm s Deep  and make haste. I can fight. No!You must do this  for me. Follow me! Forward. I mean  charge forward. Make for the lower ground! That s it! Go on! Stay together! Bring your pretty face to my axe. Wicked Men.Servants of Sauron.They are called to Mordor.The Dark One is gathering all armiesto him.It won t be long now.He will soon be ready. Ready to do what? To make his war.The last war that will coverall the world in Shadow. We ve got to get moving. Come on  Sam. Mr. Frodo.Look.It s an oliphaunt. No one at home will believe this. Smeagol? We ve lingered here too long.Come on  Sam. Wait! We re innocent travelers! There are no travelers in this land.Only servants of the Dark Tower. We are bound to an errand of secrecy.Those that claim to oppose the enemywould do well not to hinder us. The enemy?  His sense of duty was no lessthan yours  I deem. You wonder what his name is......where he came from. And if he was really evil at heart. What lies or threats led himon this long march from home. If he would not rather have stayed there......in peace. War will make corpses of us all. Bind their hands. It s true  you don t seemany Dwarf women.And in fact  they are so alikein voice and appearance......that they re often mistakenfor Dwarf men. Because I have to believehe can come back. You can t save him  Mr. Frodo. What do you know about it?Nothing!  I m sorry  Sam. I don t knowwhy I said that. I do.  It s the Ring.You can t take your eyes off it.I ve seen you.You re not eating. You barely sleep.  It s taken hold of you  Mr. Frodo. You have to fight it. I know what I have to do  Sam.The Ring was entrusted to me.It s my task.Mine! My own! Can t you hear yourself?Don t you know who you sound like? That one counts as mine!  Stinking creature. Aragorn! Aragorn? Tell me what happenedand I will ease your passing. He s......dead.He took a little tumble off the cliff. ( You lie. Get the wounded on horses.The wolves of lsengard will return.Leave the dead. Come. At last!

Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers. Now it shall cover the grave of my son. Alas that these evil days should be mine. The young perish and the old linger. That I should live......to see the last days of my house. Theodred s death was not of your making. No parent should have to bury their child. He was strong in life. His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers. Westu h l. Fer u  Th odred  Fer u. They had no warning. They were unarmed. Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold  burning as they go. Rick  cot and tree. Where is Mama? Pull back! Pull back! It s gone Mr Frodo. The light s passed on  away towards the North. Something s drawn its gaze. Hold your ground! Hold your ground! Sons of Gondor  of Rohan  my brothers. (They listen to him.) I see it in your eyes  the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of men fails  when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship  but it is not this day! An hour of wolves and shattered shields when the age of men comes crashing down  but it is not this day! This day we fight! By all that you hold dear on this good earth  I bid you stand! Men of the West! Never thought I d die fighting side by side with an elf. The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.Sauron will suffer no rival.From the summit of Barad-durhis Eye watches ceaselessly.But he is not so mighty yetthat he is above fear.Doubt ever gnaws at him.The rumor has reached him.The heir of Numenor still lives. It s the beards. This  in turn  has given riseto the belief......that there are no Dwarf women......and that Dwarves just spring outof holes in the ground... ...which is  of course  ridiculous. It s all right. Nobody panic.That was deliberate.It was deliberate. I haven t seen my niece smilefor a long time.She was a girl when they broughther father back dead.Cut down by Orcs.She watched her mothersuccumb to grief. Then she was left aloneto tend her king in growing fear.Doomed to wait upon an old manwho should have loved her as a father. Gimli.? No  I couldn tI really couldn t. Make way for the king.Make way for Theoden.Make way for the king. So few. So few of you have returned. Our people are safe.We have paid for it with many lives. My lady. Lord Aragorn......where is he? He fell. Draw all our forces behind the wall.Bar the gate.And set a watch on the surround. What of those who cannot fight  my lord?The women and children? Get them into the caves.   Saruman s arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here. Helm s Deep has one weakness.Its outer wall is solid rock......but for a small culvertat its base...... which is little more than a drain. How? How can fire undo stone? Sssh This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.  All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron. Ride out and meet him head on. Draw him away from your women and children.   You must fight. You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak. Eomer is loyal to you. His men will return and fight for their king. They will be 300 leagues from here by now. Eomer cannot help us. I know what it is you want of me......but I will not bring further death to my people. I will not risk open war. Open war is upon you  whether you would risk it or not. When last I looked......Theoden  not Aragorn  was King of Rohan. By order of the king......the city must empty. We make for the refuge of Helm s Deep. Do not burden yourself with treasures. Take only what provisions you need. Helm s Deep. They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight. Who will defend them if not their king? He s only doing what he thinks is best for his people. Helm s Deep has saved them in the past. There is no way out of that ravine. Theoden is walking into a trap. He thinks he s leading them to safety. What they will get is a massacre. Theoden has a strong will  but I fear for him. I fear for the survival of Rohan.   He will need you before the end  Aragorn. The people of Rohan will need you.  The defenses   to hold. What about side by side with a friend?   Aye! I could do that. Do you remember the Shire Mr Frodo? It will be Spring soon and the orchards will be in blossom. And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thickets. (He is crying.) And they will be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields  (Frodo opens his eyes and looks at him.) and eating the first of the strawberries and cream. Do you remember the taste of strawberries? No Sam. I can t recall the taste of food  nor the sound of water or the touch of grass. I m naked in the dark. There s  there s nothing  no veil between me and the wheel of fire.  I can see him with my waking eyes! Then let us be rid of it once and for all! Come on Mr Frodo  I can t carry it for you  but I can carry you! Come on! Aragorn!   Elessar! For Frodo. Look Mr Frodo  a doorway! We re almost there! Clever Hobbits to climb so high!  Mustn t go that way. Mustn t hurt the precious! You swore! You swore on the precious! Sauron fears you  Aragorn.He fears what you may become.And so he ll strike hard and fastat the world of Men.He will use his puppet Sarumanto destroy Rohan.War is coming.Rohan must defend itselfand therein lies our first challenge......for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.  The king s mind is enslavedit s an old device of Saruman s.His hold over King Theodenis now very strong.Sauron and Sarumanare tightening the noose.But for all their cunning......we have one advantage. The Ring remains hidden.And that we should seek to destroy it......has not yet enteredtheir darkest dreams. And so the weapon of the enemyis moving towards Mordor......in the hands of a Hobbit.Each day brings it closerto the fires of Mount Doom. We must trust now in Frodo.Everything depends upon speed......and the secrecy of his quest. Do not regret your decision to leave him.Frodo must finish this task alone. He s not alone.Sam went with him. Did he?Did he  indeed? Good. Yes  very good. The Black Gate of Mordor. Oh  save us.My old Gaffer would have a thing or twoto say if he could see us now. Master says to show himthe way into Mordor.So good Smeagol doesmaster says so. I did. That s it  then.We can t get past that. Look!The gate.It s opening!I can see a way down. Sam  no! I made some stew.It isn t much  but it s hot. Thank you.  It s good. Really? My uncle told me a strange thing.He said that you rode to warwith Thengel  my grandfather.But he must be mistaken. King Theoden has a good memory.He was only a small child at the time. Then you must be at least 60. Seventy?But you cannot be 80! Eighty-seven. You are one of the Dunedain.A descendant of Numenorblessed with long life.It was said that your racehad passed into legend. There are few of us left.The Northern Kingdomwas destroyed long ago. I m sorry. Please  eat. Did we lose him? I think we lost him. I m going to rip outyour filthy little innards! Come here! Trees. Climb a tree. What kind of devicecould bring down the wall? If the wall is breachedHelm s Deep will fall. Even if it is breached  it would takea number beyond reckoning......thousands  to storm the Keep. Tens of thousands. But  my lord  there is no such force. A new power is rising.Its victory is at hand. This night......the land will be stainedwith the blood of Rohan!March to Helm s Deep!Leave none alive! To war! There will be no dawn for Men. Look. There s smoke to the south. There is always smoke rising......from lsengard these days. Isengard? There was a time......when Saruman would walk in my woods.But now he has a mind of metal......and wheels.He no longer cares for growing things. What is it? The eagles! The eagles are coming! Frodo! I m here Sam! Destroy it! Go on! Now! Throw it in the fire! What are you waiting for? Just let it go! The Ring is mine! No! Nooooooo! Yeees!   Yeees!   Precious! My Precious! They will hold. The Grey Pilgrim. That s what they used to call me. Three hundred lives of Men I ve walked this earth  and now I have no time. With luck  my search will not be in vain.  Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn  look to the east. Go. That horse is half mad  my lord. There s nothing you can do. Leave him. F ste  stille n   f ste  stille n .

He s seen enough of war. Fifteen  sixteen. Merry! Legolas! Thirty three  thirty four. That still only counts as one! Come on then   come on! I know your face  Eowyn.   My eyes darken. No  no.

They catch you!Don t take it to him.He wants the precious.Always he is looking for it.And the precious is wantingto go back to him.But we mustn t let him have it. No!   There s another way.More secret. A dark way. Why haven t you spoken of this before? Because master did not ask. He s up to something. Are you saying there s another wayinto Mordor? Yes. There s a path......and some stairs.And then......a tunnel. He s led us this far  Sam. Mr. Frodo  no. He s been true to his word. No. Merry! Merry!   Merry it s me.   It s Pippin! I knew you d find me. Yes. Are you going to leave me? No Merry  I m going to look after you. Hands off! That shiny shirt  that s mine! Their pace has quickened.They must have caught our scent.Hurry! Come on  Gimli! Three days and nights pursuit.No food. No rest.And no sign of our quarrybut what bare rock can tell. Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall. They may yet be alive. Less than a day ahead of us. Come. Come  Gimli! We re gaining on them! I m wasted on cross-country.We Dwarves are natural sprinters.Very dangerous over short distances. He s gone. Merry! Hooom! Aaagh! Let s put a maggot hole in your belly! Run  Merry! Little Orcs. It s talking  Merry.The tree is talking. Tree?I am no tree!I am an Ent. A tree-herder.A shepherd of the forest. Don t talk to it  Merry.Don t encourage it! Treebeard  some call me. And whose side are you on?

It s Saruman s army.The war has started. Give me your hand. Take my hand. No!   Don t you let go! Don t let go! Reeeaaach! Frodo!  Frodo! Frodo. It s gone.   It s done. Yes Mr Frodo. It s over now. I can see the Shire. The Brandywine River. Bag End. Gandalf s fireworks. The lights on the party tree. Rosie Cotton dancing.   She had ribbons in her hair. If ever I was to marry someone  it would have been her.   It would ve been her. I m glad to be with you Samwise Gamgee here at the end of all things. They hug. I am steward of the house of An rion. Thus have I walked  and thus now I will sleep. Gondor is lost. There is no hope for men.   Why do the fools fly? Better to die sooner than late. For die we must. No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No long slow sleep of death embalmed. We shall burn like the heathen Kings of old.   Bring wood and oil. Steady! Steady! You are soldiers of Gondor. No matter what comes through that gate you will stand your ground. Volley!   Fire! Let him go  you filth! Let him go! You will not touch him again!   Come on then  finish it! Keep breathing. That s the key.Breathe. They ve run as if the very whipsof their masters were behind them. We re not going no further......until we ve had a breather. Get a fire going! Merry!Merry! I think we might have made a mistakeleaving the Shire  Pippin. What s making that noise? It s the trees. Peregrin Took my lad  there is a task now to be done. Another opportunity for one of the Shire folk to prove their great worth.   You must not fail me. It s been very quiet across the river. The Orcs are lying low. The garrison may have moved out. We ve sent scouts to Cair Andros. If the Orcs attack from the North  we ll have some warning. Quiet. We need 10 more. No. I go to my fathers  in whose mighty company; I shall not now feel ashamed. Eowyn. Release us! Bad idea! Very handy in a tight spot these lads  despite the fact they re dead. You gave us your word! I hold your oath fulfilled. Go. Be at peace. Merry! Nooooo! Nooooooo! Noooooo! Lead the way  Smeagol. Good Smeagol always helps. Hello?Treebeard?Where has he gone? I had the loveliest dream last night.There was this large barrelfull of pipe-weed.And we smoked all of it.And then......you were sick.I d give anything for a whiff of Old Toby. Did you hear that?There it is again.Something s not right here.Not right at all. You just said something...Treeish. No  I didn t. I was just stretching. You re taller. Who? You! Than what? Than me!

It s going to the Great Eye  along with everything else. I don t take orders from stinking Morgul-rats! You touch it and I ll stick this blade in your gut! The scum tried to knife me. Kill him! That s for Frodo! And the Shire! And that s for my old gaffer! Stop your squealing you dunghill rat! I m gonna bleed you like a stuck pig! Not if I stick you first! Sam! Oh Sam  I m so sorry. Sorry for everything. Let s get you out of here. Rohan.Home of the Horse-lords.There s something strange at work here.Some evil gives speedto these creatures.Sets its will against us. Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see? The Uruks turn northeast.They are taking the Hobbits to lsengard. Saruman. The world is changing.Who now has the strength to standagainst the armies of Isengard......and Mordor?To stand against the might of Sauronand Saruman......and the union of the two towers? Together  my Lord Sauron...... we shall rule this Middle-earth. The Old World will burnin the fires of industry.The forests will fall.A new order will rise.We will drive the machine of warwith the sword and the spear...... and the iron fists of the Orc. We have only to remove those who oppose us. I want them armed and ready to marchwithin two weeks! But  my lord  there are too many!They cannot all be armed in timewe don t have the means. Build a dam  block the streamwork the furnaces night and day. We don t have enough fuelto feed the fires. Hobbits?Never heard of a Hobbit before.Sounds like Orc mischief to me!  They come with fire.They come with axes.Gnawing  biting  breakinghacking  burning! Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them! No!You don t understand. We re Hobbits!Halflings!Shire-folk! Maybe you are......and maybe you aren t.The White Wizard will know. The White Wizard? Saruman. See? See?We ve led you out.Hurry  Hobbitses. Hurry! Very lucky we find you.  Nice Hobbit. It s a bog. He s led us into a swamp. A swamp  yes  yes.Come  master. We will take youon safe paths through the mist.Come  Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.  I found it. I did.The way through the marshes.Orcs don t use it.Orcs don t know it.They go around for miles and miles.Come quickly.Soft and quick as shadows we must be. I hate this place. It s too quiet.There s been no sight nor soundof a bird for two days. No  no birdses to eat.No crunchable birdses.We are famished! Yes!Famished we are  precious! Here. What does it eats?Is it tasty?  It tries to chokes us!We can t eats Hobbit food!We must starve! Well  starve  then. And good riddance! Oh  cruel Hobbit.It does not care if we be hungry.Does not care if we should die.  Not like master.Master cares.Master knows.Yes.Precious.Once it takes hold of us......it never lets go. Don t touch me! Fly  you fools! No!Gandalf! Gandalf! What is it  Mr. Frodo? Nothing.Just a dream. Can you see the bottom? No! Don t look down  Sam!Just keep going! Catch it! Grab it  Mr. Frodo! Mr. Frodo! I think I ve found the bottom. Bogs and ropeand goodness knows what.It s not natural. None of it. What s in this? Nothing.Just a bit of seasoning.I thought maybe if we was havinga roast chicken one night or something. Roast chicken?! Back! Mr Frodo! Oh no! Frodo  Mr Frodo.   Wake up. Don t leave me here alone. Don t go where I can t follow. Wake up. Not asleep. Dead. You get back you scum! What s this? Killed another one has she? No.   This fellow ain t dead.   Not dead. She jabs him with her stinger and he goes as limp as a boned fish aaa  then she has her way with them. That s how she likes to feed. Fresh blood. Get him to the Tower! Samwise you fool. This scum will be awake in a couple of hours. Then he ll wish he d never been born. The house of his spirit crumbles.  He is burning. Already burning. What? You remember the Old Foreston the borders of Buckland?Folk used to say there was something inthe water that made the trees grow tall......and come alive. Alive? Trees that could whisper......talk to each other......even move. I m starving.We ain t had nothing but maggoty breadfor three stinking days. Yeah!Why can t we have some meat?!  What about them?They re fresh. They are not for eating. What about their legs?They don t need those. They look tasty. Get back  scum!The prisoners go to Saruman.Alive and unspoiled. Alive?  Why alive?Do they give good sport? They have something.An Elvish weapon.The master wants it for the war. They think we have the Ring. Ssh!As soon as they find out we don twe re dead. Kill him. They re not coming from the North! To the river quick  quick! Go  come on! Faster!   Draw swords. Hold! Hold them! What? Amon D n. The beacon! The beacon of Amon D n is lit. Hope is kindled! The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit! Gondor calls for aid. And Rohan will answer! Muster the Rohirrim.   Assemble the army at Dunharrow  as many men as can be found. You have two days.   On the third  we ride for Gondor  and war. Forward! Three-foot-eight.You did something. Merry  don t! Don t drink it! Merry!No  Treebeard said that youshouldn t have any. I want some! lt could well be dangerous! Give me it back. Merry! What s happening?! Aaagh!It s got my leg! Merry! Help! Away with you.You should not be waking.Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water. Go to sleep.Away with you.  Come  the forest is waking up. It isn t safe.The trees have grown wildand dangerous.Anger festers in their hearts.Black are their thoughts.Strong is their hate.They will harm you if they can.There are too few of us now.Too few of us Ents left to manage them. It s too late. It s over. They ve taken it Sam  they took the Ring! Begging your pardon but they haven t. I thought I d lost you. So I took it  only for safekeeping. Give it to me!   Give me the Ring Sam.   Sam! Give me the Ring.   You must understand. The Ring is my burden. It will destroy you Sam. Come on Mr Frodo. We d best find you some clothes. You can t go walking through Mordor in nowt but your skin. We did it Mr Frodo. We made it to Mordor. There are so many of them. We ll never get through unseen. It s Him  the Eye! We have to go in there Mr Frodo. There s nothing for it.   Come on let s just make it down the hill for starters. Frodo has passed beyond my sight.   The darkness is deepening. If Sauron had the Ring we would know it. It s only a matter of time. He has suffered a defeat  yes  but behind the walls of Mordor our enemy is regrouping. Let him stay there! Let him rot! Why should we care? Because 10 000 Orcs now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom. The Forest of Fangornlies on our doorstep. Burn it. Yes. We will fight for you. Swear it. We will die for Saruman. The Horse-Men took your lands.They drove your people into the hillsto scratch a living off rocks. Murderers! Take back the lands they stole from you.Burn every village! We have only to remove thosewho oppose us.It will begin in Rohan.Too long have these peasantsstood against you.But no more. Eothain! Eothain!You take your sister.You ll go faster with just two. Listen to me. You must ride to Edorasand raise the alarm. Do you understand me? There are dead things!Dead faces in the water. All dead. All rotten.Elves and Men and Orcses.A great battle long ago.Dead Marshes.Yes. Yes  that is their name.This way.Don t follow the lights. Careful now! Or Hobbits go downto join the dead ones......and light little candlesof their own. Frodo! Gollum? Don t follow the lights. Gollum! Mr. Frodo!Are you all right? So bright.So beautiful. (strokes his own palm)Our precious. What did you say? Master should be resting.Master needs to keep up his strength. Who are you? Mustn t ask us. Not its business.Gollum. Gollum. It must be getting near teatime. Leastways it would be in decent places where there is still teatime. We re not in decent places. Mr Frodo? What is it? It s just a feeling. I don t think I ll be coming back. Yes you will. Of course you will. That s just morbid thinking. We re going there and back again just like Mr Bilbo. You ll see. I think these lands were once part of the Kingdom of Gondor. Long ago  when there was a King. Mr Frodo  look! The King has got a crown again. What are they eating when they can t get hobbit ? Who is she ? This woman you sing of ? Tis the Lady of L thien. The Elf Maiden who gave her love to Beren ... a mortal What happened to her? She died. The power of Isengard is at your command Sauron. Lord of the Earth Stay close young hobbits. Frodo!   Frodo! ..and are never seen again Your coming to us   is as the footsteps of doom. You bring great evil here!  Ringbearer! Mr Frodo ? Well! Here s one dwarf she won t ensnare so easily! I have the eyes of a hawk  and ears of a fox! Oh! The dwarf breathes so loud  we could have shot him in the dark. Mae govannen  Legolas Thranduilion. You never know. Sam. My dear Sam. It s very special  that.It s the best salt in all the Shire. It is special. It s a little bit of home. We can t leave this here for someoneto follow us down. Who s gonna follow us down hereMr. Frodo?It s a shame  really.Lady Galadriel gave me that.Real Elvish rope. Well  there s nothing for it.It s one of my knots.Won t come free in a hurry. Real Elvish rope. Mordor. The one place in Middle-earthwe don t want to see any closer.And it s the one placewe re trying to get to.It s just where we can t get. Let s face it  Mr. Frodo  we re lost.I don t think Gandalf meant for us tocome this way. He didn t mean for a lot of thingsto happen  Sam......but they did. Mr. Frodo?It s the Ring  isn t it? It s getting heavier. What food have we got left? Let me see.Oh  yes. Lovely.Lembas bread. And look!More lembas bread. I don t usually hold with foreign food.....but this Elvish stuff  it s not bad. Nothing ever dampens your spiritsdoes it  Sam? My old sword  Sting   Here  take it  take it. Its so light! Yes Yes   Made by the elves you know. The blade glows blue when orcs are close and its times like that my lad  when you have to be extra careful. Here s a pretty thing.   Mithril!   as light as a feather and as hard as dragon scales. Let me see you put it on  go on. My my old ring. Well I should... very much like to hold it again  one last time. I m sorry I brought this upon you my boy   I m sorry that you must carry this burden   I m sorry for everything The Ringbearer is setting out on the quest of Mount Doom and you who travel with him    no oath nor bond is laid to go further than you will   Farewell. Hold to your purpose and may the blessings of elves   and men    and all free folk   go with you. You are no elf Men of the South are welcome here Who are you ? I m a friend of Gandalf the Grey Then we are here on a common purpose   friend. The shards of Narsil   The blade that cut the Ring from Sauron s hand   Ah!  Its still sharp   but no more than a broken heirloom Why do you fear the past. You are Isildur s heir  not Isildur himself. You are not bound to his fate He s not dead. HE S NOT DEAD   NO! NO! He s not dead. Farewell Peregrin son of Paladin. NO! NO! I release you from my service.  Go now and die and what way seems best to you. Come on soldier  move it. Hurry along there  hurry along. Gandalf!   Where s Gandalf?   GANDALF! Just a mouthful......a bit of the flank. Looks like meat s back on the menuboys. Pippin.Let s go. Go on.Call for help. Squeal.No one s going to save you now. Pippin! Aaaaaaaagh! A red sun rises.Blood has been spilled this night. Riders of Rohan......what news from the Mark? What business does an Elf  a Manand a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?Speak quickly! Give me your name  horse-masterand I shall give you mine. I would cut off your head  Dwarf......if it stood but a little higherfrom the ground. You would die before your stroke fell. I am Aragorn  son of Arathorn.This is Gimli  son of Gloinand Legolas of the Woodland Realm.We are friends of Rohanand of Theoden  your king. Theoden no longer recognizesfriend from foe. Not even his own kin.  Saruman has poisoned the mindof the king......and claimed lordship over these lands. My company are those loyal to Rohan.And for that  we are banished.The White Wizard is cunning.He walks here and there  they say......as an old man hooded and cloaked.And everywhere  his spiesslip past our nets. Very good sir. Gamling. My lord! Make haste across the Riddermark. Summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow. I will. Do you ride with us? Just to the encampment. It s tradition for the women of the court to farewell the men.   The men have found their captain. They will follow you into battle. Even to death. You have given us hope. Excuse me!   I have a sword. Please accept it!   I offer you my service Theoden King. And gladly  I accept it.   You shall be Meriadoc  esquire of Rohan. Horse men! I wish I could muster an army of Dwarves  fully armed and filthy. Your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war. I fear war already marches on their own lands. Now is the hour  Riders of Rohan. Oaths you have taken. Now fulfil them all  to Lord and Land! Hah! Why are there so few of youwhen you have lived so long? Are there Ent children? Bru-ra-hroom.There have been no Entingsfor a terrible long count of years. Why is that? We lost the Entwives. Oh  I m sorry. How did they die? Die? No.We lost them.And now we cannot find them. I don t suppose you ve seen Entwives in the Shire? Can t say that I have. You  Pip? What do they look like? I don t remember now. Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. There dwells Theoden  King of Rohan...... whose mind is overthrown. Saruman s hold over King Theoden is now very strong. My lord  your son......he is dead.   My lord? Uncle? Will you not go to him? Will you do nothing? Be careful what you say.Do not look for welcome here. Oh  he must have died sometime in the night. What a tragedy for the king......to lose his only son and heir. I ve sent him to his death. No. There is still hope for Frodo. He needs time and safe passage across the plains of Gorgoroth. We can give him that. How? Draw out Sauron s armies. Empty his lands. Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate. We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms. Not for ourselves. But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron s eye fixed upon us. Keep him blind to all else that moves. A diversion. Certainty of death  small chance of success  what are we waiting for? Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not take the bait. Oh  I think he will. Long have you hunted me. Long have I eluded you. No more!   Behold  the Sword of Elendil! Yes  Mama. I don t want to leave.I don t want to go  Mama. Freda  I will find you there. Quickly!  Go  child. Rohan  my lord......is ready to fall. Theodred.Find the king s son! Mordor will pay for this These Orcs are not from Mordor. My Lord Eomer  over here! He s alive. Theodred. Your son is badly wounded  my lord. He was ambushed by Orcs.If we don t defend our countrySaruman will take it by force That is a lie.Saruman the White has ever beenour friend and ally. Gandalf told me you wereone of the river-folk. Cold be heart and hand and boneCold be travellers far from home He said your life was a sad story. They do not see what lies aheadWhen sun has failed and moon is dead You were not so very differentfrom a Hobbit once.Were you?Smeagol. What did you call me?

You re in the service of the steward now. You ll have to do as you are told Peregrin Took. Ridiculous Hobbit! Guard of the Citadel! Thank you. There s no more stars! Is it time? Yes. It s so quiet. It s the deep breath before the plunge. I don t want to be in a battle. But waiting on the edge of one I can t escape is even worse.   Is there any hope Gandalf  for Frodo and Sam? There never was much hope. Just a fool s hope.   Our enemy is ready. His full strength s gathered. Not only orcs  but men as well   Legions of Haradrim from the South  mercenaries from the coast   All will answer Mordor s call. Come on! Build me an army worthy of Mordor What orders from Mordor my Lord? What does the Eye command? We have work to do The trees are strong my Lord.

Maybe he does deserve to die.But now that I see him  I do pity him. We be nice to themif they be nice to us.Take it off us.We swears to do what you wants................We swears. Mr Frodo ?   Frodo! Frodo!   I thought I d lost you What are you talking about ? It s just something Gandalf said. What did he say? The Fellowship awaits the Ringbearer. Mordor  Gandalf  is it left or right ? Left. We must hold this course west of the Misty Mountains for forty days. If our luck holds the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us.   and there are road turns east to Mordor. Good  very good. Move your feet You look good Pippin Thanks If anyone was to ask for my opinion  which I note that they re not  I d say that we were taking the long way round. Gandalf  we could pass through the Mines of Moria. My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome. No Gimli  I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice. ARGH! Sorry! Get him! For the Shire. Hold him  hold him down Merry! Gentlemen  that s enough! The same blood flows in my veins   The same weakness Your time will come.

I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the ages of this world alone I choose a mortal life You cannot give me this It is mine to give to whom I will. Like my heart Strangers from distant lands  friends of old. You have been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor. Middle Earth stands upon the brink of destruction. None can escape it. You will unite or you will fall. Each race is bound to this fate  this one doom.  Bring forth the Ring  Frodo So it s true In a dream   I saw the Eastern sky grow dark  In the West a pale light lingered A voice was crying  your doom is near at hand   Isildur s bane is found   Isildur s Bane We are no spies.We track a party of Uruk-haiwestward across the plain.They have taken two of our friendscaptive. The Uruks are destroyed.We slaughtered them during the night. But there were two Hobbits.Did you see two Hobbits with them? They would be small.Only children to your eyes. We left none alive.We piled the carcasses and burned them. Dead? I am sorry. Hasufel! Arod!  May these horses bear you to betterfortune than their former masters. Farewell. Look for your friends.But do not trust to hope.It has forsaken these lands. We ride north! It s one of their wee belts. Hiro hyn h dh  ab  wanath... Aaaaagh! I understand. His passing is hard to accept. Especially now that your brother has deserted you. Leave me alone  snake! Oh  but you are alone. Who knows what you ve spoken to the darkness  ......in the bitter watches of the night......when all your life seems to shrink. The walls of your bower closing in about you. A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.  So fair. So cold. Like a morning of pale spring......still clinging to winter s chill. Your words are poison. You ll find more cheer in a graveyard. I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed  Gandalf Greyhame. By order of Grima Wormtongue. Your staff Hmmm  You would not part an old man from his walking stick. My lord  Gandalf the Grey is coming. He s a herald of woe. The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late......Theoden King. He s not welcome. Why should I welcome you......Gandalf Stormcrow? A just question  my liege.  Late is the hour......in which this conjurer chooses to appear.  Lathspell I name him.Ill news is an ill guest. Be silent. Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.

Warmongering? How long is it sinceSaruman bought you?What was the promised price  Grima?When all the Men are deadyou will take your share of the treasure? Too long have you watched my sister.Too long have you haunted her steps. You see much  Eomer  son of Eomund.

Aragorn  nad no ennas This will be the end of Gondor as we know it. Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.   If the river is taken  if the garrison at Osgiliath falls  the last defence of this city will be gone. But we have the white wizard. That s got to count for something. Gandalf? Sauron has yet to show his deadliest servant.   The one who will lead Mordor s army in war.   The one they say no living man can kill.   The Witch King of Angmar. You ve met him before.   He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.   He is the lord of the Nazg l. The greatest of the nine. The Dead City! Very nasty place full of enemies. Quick  quick! They will see  they will see!

It began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to the elves.  Immortal  wisest and fairest of all beings.   Seven to the dwarf lords  great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.  And nine  nine rings were gifted to the race of men.   Who above all else  desire power. Tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country. Hail the victorious dead Hail! No pauses    no spills. Better than it was and the Ring ?   You feel its power growing don t you. I ve felt it too. You must be careful now. Evil will be drawn to you from outside the Fellowship and I fear from within. Who then do I trust ? You must trust to yourself. Trust your own strength. What do you mean ? There are many powers in this world for good or for evil. Some are greater than I am and against some I have not yet been tested Ah! The walls of Moria! Dwarf doors are invisible when closed Yes Gimli! Their own masters cannot find them  if their secrets are forgotten! Why doesn t that surprise me! Ach! It reads \"The Doors of Durin  Lord of Moria  Speak Friend and Enter\" What do you suppose that means ? Oh it s quite simple.

Never before has anyone uttered words of that tongue here in Imladris I do not ask your pardon Master Elrond for the Black Speech of Mordor may yet be heard in every corner of the West   The Ring is altogether evil Aye it is a gift!  A gift to the foes of Mordor. Why not use this Ring ?   Long has my father  the Steward of Gondor kept the forces of Mordor at bey. By the  of our people are your lands kept safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy  let us use it against him You cannot wield it. None of us can   The One Ring answers to Sauron alone. It has no other master and what would a ranger know of this matter ? Aragorn! This.. is Isildur s heir and heir to the throne of Gondor Havo dad  Legolas ( .) Gondor has no King.   Gondor needs no King Aragorn is right. We cannot use it You have only one choice. The Ring must be destroyed. Then what are we waiting for The Ring cannot be destroyed  Gimli  son of Gloin  by any craft that we here possess. The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom. Only there can it be unmade. It must be taken deep into Mordor and cast back into the firey chasm from whence it came.  One of you........... must do this We failed them. A Hobbit lay here.And the other. They crawled. Their hands were bound. Their bonds were cut. They ran over here. They were followed The belt!  Run! Tracks lead away from the battle... ...into Fangorn Forest. Fangorn?What madness drove them in there? Theoden......son of Thengel......too long have you sat in the Shadows. I would stay still if I were you. Hearken to me! I release you......from the spell. You have no power here ......Gandalf the  . I will draw you  Saruman  as poison is drawn from a wound. Wait. If I go  Theoden dies. You did not kill me......you will not kill him. Rohan is mine. Be gone. I know your face.  Eowyn. Eowyn.  Gandalf? Breathe the free air again  my friend. Dark have been my dreams of late. Man cenich? The White Wizard approaches. Do not let him speak.He will put a spell on us. We must be quick. You are tracking the footstepsof two young Hobbits. Where are they? Who are you?Show yourself! It cannot be. Forgive me. I mistook you for Saruman. I am Saruman.Or rather  Sarumanas he should have been. You fell. Through fire.....and water. From the lowest dungeonto the highest peak...... I fought with the Balrogof Morgoth. Until at last I threw downmy enemy......and smote his ruinupon the mountainside. No! Hide  hide! I can feel his blade.   We come to it at last.  The great battle of our time. Come away Hobbits. We climb. We must climb. The board is set  the pieces are moving. Up  up  up the stairs we go. And then it s into the tunnel. Hey  what s in this tunnel?   You listen to me! You listen good and proper. Anything happens to him  you ll have me to answer to. One sniff that something s not right  one hair that stands up on the back of my neck  its over. No more slinker  no more stinker.   You re gone. Got it? I m watching you. What was that about? Nothing. Just clearing something up. Gwaihir go! Gwaihir What are they saying ? Frodo f r. Ae athradon i hir  tur gwaith nin beriatha hon.   There s been some strange folk crossing the Shire. Dwarves  others of a less than savoury nature War s brewing.   The mountains are fair teeming with goblins. Children s stories that s all that is. You re beginning to sound like that old Bilbo Baggins! Cracked he was! Hello  Hello  Fatty Bolger   Lovely to see you  Welcome  Welcome Go on Sam  ask Rosie for a dance. Take her by the safest road. A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens. It waits to carry her across the sea. The last journey of Arwen Und miel. There is nothing for you here only death. Lady Arwen we cannot delay.   My lady! Tell me what you have seen. Arwen. You have the gift of foresight. What did you see? I looked into your future and I saw death. But there is also life. You saw there was a child. You saw my son. For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race.   But they were all of them deceived.  For another ring was made.   In the land of Mordor   in the fires of Mount Doom (  the dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a master Ring  to control all others and into this Ring he poured all his cruelty  his malice   and his will to dominate all life.   One Ring to rule them all. One by one the free lands of Middle Earth fell to the power of the Ring. But there were some who resisted.   A last alliance of Elves and Men marched against the armies of Mordor. And on the slopes of Mount Doom they fought for the freedom of Middle Earth. Tangado haid! Leithio i philinn! Victory was near.   But the power of the Ring   could not be undone. It was in this moment   that Isildur  son of the King  took up his father s sword. Sauron  the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle Earth was defeated.   The Ring passed to Isildur.   Who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.   But the hearts of Men are easily corrupted.   And the Ring of Power has a will of its own. It betrayed Isildur  to his death.  And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost.  History became legend  legend became myth    and for two and a half thousand years the Ring passed out of all knowledge.   Until  when chance came   It ensnared a new bearer. My Precious! The Ring came to the creature Gollum who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains.   And there it consumed him. It came to me  my own  my love  my own  my Precious. The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum s cave it waited.   Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumour grew of a shadow in the East  whispers of a nameless fear.   And the Ring of Power perceived.   Its time had now come.   It abandoned Gollum.   But something happened then that the Ring did not intend  it was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable. What s this? A Hobbit. Bilbo Baggins of the Shire. And no regurgitation! So  it s a drinking game? Aye! Last one standing wins heh heh heh! Lets drink to Victory! To Victory! West  Aragorn  hal I am very happy for you. He is an honourable man. You are both honourable men. It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our people to victory. Ach  don t listen to me. You are young and tonight is for you. Heh heh heh heh  Here  here.   Raaar it s the dwarves that go swimming with little  hairy women haha I feel something.   A slight tingle in my fingers. I think it s affecting me. heh heh heh   what did I say? He can t hold his liquor. Game over! Oh you can search far and wide  You can drink the whole town dry   But you ll never find a beer so brown  But you ll never find a beer so brown  As the one we drink in our hometown  As the one we drink in our hometown.  You can drink your fancy ales  You can drink them by the flagon But the only brew for the brave and true  Nothing s happening I once knew every spell in all the tongues of elves  men and orcs What re you going to do then ? Knock your head against these doors Peregrin Took! and if that does not shatter them and I m allowed a little peace from foolish questions I will try to find the opening words. Ando Eldarinwa a lasta quettanya  Fenda Casarinwa  The Mines are no place for a pony even one so brave as Bill. BuBye Bill Go on  go on  Don t worry Sam. He knows the way home.  ) Do not disturb the water Oh it s useless It s a riddle! Speak friend... and enter. What s the elvish word for friend ? Mel..lon No. Ashes and dust and thirst there isand pits  pits  pits.And Orcses  thousands of Orcses.And always the Great Eye watching watching. Hey! Come back now! Come back!There! What did I tell you?He s run off  the old villain.So much for his promises. This way  Hobbits.Follow me! Merry!Merry! You re lateOur master grows impatient.He wants the Shire-rats now. I don t take orders from Orc-maggots.Saruman will have his prize.We will deliver them. Merry! Merry? Wake up My friend is sick.He needs water. Please! Sick  is he?Give him some medicine  boys! Stop it! Can t take his draught! Leave him alone! Why?You want some? Then keep your mouth shut. Yes Pippin  my point is  he s clearly over reacting! Run! Ooh! that was close! Oh! I think I ve broken something Trust a Brandybuck and a Took! What? It was just a detour. A shortcut A shortcut to what ? Mushrooms! I think we should get off the road. Get off the road! Quick! Ssh.. be quiet What was that! Anything ? Nothing What is going on ? So Gandalf  you try to lead them over Caradhras. And if that fails  where then will you go ? If the mountain defeats you will you risk a more dangerous road Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse; nai yarvaxea rasselya! There is a fell voice on the air It s Saruman! He s trying to bring down the mountain! Gandalf! We must turn back! No!   Losto Caradhras  sedho  hodo  nuitho i  ruith! Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse; Nai yarvaxea rasselya; taltuva notto-carinnar! We must get off the mountain! Make for the Gap of Rohan and take the west road to my city! The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard! If we cannot pass over the mountain  let us go under it! Let us go through the Mines of Moria Moria... you fear to go into those mines. the dwarves delved too greadily and too deep You know what they woke in the dark of Khazad-d m Shadow  flame One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep and the great eye is ever watchful. Tis a barren wasteland  riddled with fire and ash and dust. The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with ten thousand men could you do this.  It is folly Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The Ring must be destroyed and I suppose you think you re the one to do it. and if we fail what then ?   What happens when Sauron takes back what is his ? I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an elf Never trust an elf Do you not understand that while we bicker amongst ourselves  Sauron s power grows?! None can escape it! You ll all be destroyed Your fingers would remember their old strength better......if they grasped your sword. I ve only......ever served you  my lord. Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast! Send me not from your sight. No  my lord! No  my lord. Let him go. Enough blood has been spilt on his account. Get out of my way! Hail  Theoden King! Where is Theodred? Where is my son? Darkness took me......and I strayed out of thoughtand time. Stars wheeled overhead......and every day was as longas a life age of the Earth.But it was not the end.I felt life in me again. I ve been sent back...... until my task is done. Gandalf. Gandalf?  Yes.That was what they used to call me.Gandalf the Grey.That was my name. Gandalf. I am Gandalf the White.And I come back to you now......at the turn of the tide. One stage of your journey is over.Another begins. We must travel to Edoras with all speed. Edoras?That is no short distance! We hear of trouble in Rohan.It goes ill with the king. Yes  and it will not be easily cured. Then we have run all this way for nothing?Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here......in this horrid  dark  dank tree-infested--?  I mean  charming......quite charming forest. It was more than mere chance thatbrought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.A great power has been sleeping herefor many long years.The coming of Merry and Pippinwill be like the falling of small stones......that starts an avalanchein the mountains. In one thing you have not changeddear friend. You still speak in riddles. A thing is about to happen that has nothappened since the Elder Days.The Ents are going to wake up.....and find that they are strong. Young Mr Frodo here  he s cracking! and proud of it! Cheers Gaffer! Cheers Well it s none of our concern what goes on beyond our borders. Keep your nose out of trouble and no trouble will come to you. Good Night lads Good night  sweet maiden of the golden ale! Oi Mind who you re sweet talking! Don t worry Sam  Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one! Does she ? Good Night Sam Is it secret ? Is it safe ? Ha!   What are you doing! Hold out your hand Frodo. Its quite cool.   What can you see ?   Can you see anything ? Nothing. There s nothing   Wait. There are markings   Its some form of Elvish. I can t read it There are few who can. The language is that of Mordor  which I will not utter here. Ah  I think I ll just have another ale. Oh no you dont   Go on So there I was at the mercy of three monstrous trolls and they were all arguing amongst themselves about how they were going to cook us. Whether it be turned on a spit or whether they should sit on us one by one and squash us into jelly.   They spent so much time arguing the witherto s and whyfor s that the sun s first light cracked open over the top of the trees. Poof!   and turned them all into stone! Quickly No no! the big one  big one! Mrs Bracegirdle  how nice to see you. Welcome welcome. Are all these children yours ? Yeah Good gracious you have been productive! Sackville-Bagginses!   Quickly! Hide! Oh! Thankyou my boy You re a good lad Frodo. I m very selfish you know.   Yes  I am. Very selfish. I don t know why I took you in after your mother and father died  but it wasn t out of charity. I think it was because  of all my numerous relations  you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit. Bilbo have you been at the Gaffers homebrew ? No. Well yes  b b b but thats not the point. The point is  Frodo    You ll be alright. That future is almost gone. But it is not lost. Nothing is certain. Some things are certain. If I leave him now  I will regret it forever. It is time. From the ashes of fire shall be woken  A light from the shadow shall spring  Renewed shall be blade that was broken  The crownless again shall be king. Reforge the sword  ada. Your hands are cold. The life of the Eldar is leaving you. This was my choice. Ada  whether by your will or not there is no ship now that can bear me hence. We have just passed into the realm of Gondor. Minas Tirith. City of Kings. It s the tree! Gandalf  Gandalf. Yes the white tree of Gondor. The tree of the King. Lord Denethor however  is not the King. He is a steward only  a caretaker of the throne. Now listen carefully. Lord Denethor is Boromir s father. To give him news of his beloved son s death would be most unwise. And do not mention Frodo or the Ring. And say nothing of Aragorn either. In fact  its better if you don t speak at all Peregrin Took. Hail Denethor son of Ecthelion  Lord and Steward of Gondor. A Ring! Lost!   My Precious is lost. For the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all. The 22nd day of September in the year 1400  by Shire reckoning.   Bag End  Bagshot Row  Hobbiton  West Farthing  The Shire  Middle Earth.   The Third Age of this world. There and back again  A Hobbit s tale  by Bilbo Baggins.  Now  where to begin? Ah  yes.  Concerning Hobbits. Hobbits have been living and farming in the four Farthings of the Shire for many hundreds of years.   quite content to ignore and be ignored by the world of the Big Folk.   Middle Earth being  after all  full of strange creatures beyond count. Hobbits must seem of little importance  being neither renowned as great warriors  nor counted amongst the very wise. Frodo  someone at the door.  In fact  it has been remarked by some that Hobbits  only real passion is for food.   A rather unfair observation   As we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales  and the smoking of pipeweed.   But where our hearts truly lie   is in peace and quiet  and good tilled earth.  For all Hobbits share a love of all things that grow.  And yes  no doubt to others  our ways seem quaint   But today of all days  it is brought home to me it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life. Frodo  the door!   sticklebacks  where is that boy! FRODO! Hmm hmm hmm hmm  Down from the door where it began  hmm hmm hmm hmm And I must follow if I can.   The road goes ever on and on  down from the door where it began  now far ahead the road has gone  and I must follow if I can. You re late! Pippin! Comes from the Green Dragon! Thank you! I win! No news of Frodo? No word. Nothing. We have time. Every day Frodo moves closer to Mordor. Do we know that? What does your heart tell you? That Frodo is alive. Yes  yes he s alive. Too risky. Too risky.  Thieves. They stole it from us. Kill them  kill them  kill them both!   No! Sshh  quiet  mustn t wake them. Mustn t ruin it now. But they knows    they knows  they suspects us! What s it saying my precious  my love? Is Smeagol losing his nerve? Soon Mr Elf  you will enjoy the fabelled hospitality of the dwarves. Roaring fires! Malt Beer! Red Meat off the bone! This my friend is the home of my cousin Balin and they call it a Mine! A Mine! This isn t a mine  it s a tomb Nooooo! NOOOOOOOOOOoooooooo! Goblins! We make for the gap of Rohan. We should never have come here Now get out of here! Get out! Merry. Hello  Pip. You re hurt. I m fine. lt was just an act. An act? See? I fooled you too.Don t worry about me  Pippin. What is it? What do you smell? Man-flesh They ve picked up our trail. Aragorn. Let s move! That black rider was looking for something. Or someone (he walks up to Frodo and looks him in the face) Frodo ? Get down! I have to leave the Shire.  Sam and I must get to Bree Right. Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me. Run! Frodo  this way. Follow me Frodo! Follow me. Run! Get the rope Sam Frodo! Run Frodo! No! Frodo! Come on! Let the Ringbearer decide We cannot stay here!  This will be the death of the hobbits! Frodo ? We will go through the Mines So be it Strong?!  Oh  that s good. So stop your fretting  Master Dwarf.Merry and Pippin are quite safe.In fact  they are far saferthan you are about to be. This new Gandalf s more grumpythan the old one. That is one of the Mearas......unless my eyes are cheatedby some spell. Shadowfax.He is the lord of all horses......and has been my friendthrough many dangers. ls it much further? Bru-ra-hroom. Don t be hasty.You might call it far  perhaps.My home lies deep in the forest......near the roots of the mountain.I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.And safe is where I ll keep you.I believe you will enjoy this next one too.  It s one of my own compositions.Right. Sleep  little Shirelings.Heed no nightly noise.Sleep till morning light.I have business in the forest.There are many to call.Many that must come.  The Shadow lies on Fangorn.The withering of all woodsis drawing near. Mordor! In the common tongue it says Done! You re supposed to stick it in the ground It is in the ground Outside It was your idea! Bilbo! Bilbo! Watch out for the dragon Dragon! Nonsense  there hasn t been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years. That was good! Lets get another one! Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took! I might have known! Speech Bilbo Speech! My dear Bagginses and Boffins    Tooks and Brandybucks    Grubbs    Chubbs    Hornblowers    Bulgers    Bracegirdles    and Proudfoots PROUDFEET! I come with tidings in this dark hour and with counsel. Perhaps you come to explain this. Perhaps you have come to tell me why my son is dead. Boromir died to save us my kinsman and me. He fell defending us from many foes. Pippin. I offer you my service  such as it is in payment of this debt. This is my first command to you. How did you escape and my son did not? So mighty as man as he was. The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow and Boromir was pierced by many. Get up! My lord  there will be a time to grieve for Boromir but it is not now. War is coming. The enemy is on your doorstep. As steward  you are charged with the defence of this city. Where are Gondor s armies? You still have friends. You are not alone in this fight. Send word to Theoden of Rohan. Light the beacons. You think you are wise Mithrandir. Yet for all your subtleties you have not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor and with your right you would seek to supplant me. I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan. Oh yes  word has reached my ears of this Aragorn  son of Arathorn. And I tell you now. I will not bow to this Ranger from the North. Last of a ragged house long bereft of Lordship. Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the King  steward. The rule of Gondor is mine and no others! Come! All had turned to vain ambition. He would use even his grief as a cloak! A thousand years this city has stood and now at the whim of a madman it will fall! And the white tree  the tree of the King will never bloom again. A wizard is never late! Frodo Baggins.   Nor is he early  he arrives precisely when he means to. Its wonderful to see you Gandalf. You didn t think Id miss your Uncle Bilbo s birthday? So how is the old rascal? I hear it is going to be a party of special significance? You know Bilbo he s got the whole place in an uproar. Well that should please him. Half the Shire s been invited. And the rest of them are turning up anyway. And so life in the Shire goes on  very much as it has this past age.   Full of its own comings and goings with change coming slowly  if it comes at all.  For things are made to endure in the Shire  passing from one generation to the next. There s always been a Baggins living here under the Hill  in Bag End And there always will be. To tell you the truth  Bilbo has been acting a bit odd lately.  I mean  more than usual. He s taken to locking himself in his study.   He spends hours and hours poring over old maps when he thinks I m not looking. Where s it gone? Aaaaah. He s up to something.   All right then  keep your secrets! What? No! No! Never! Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses. Smeagol wants to see them . Dead! And we will! Smeagol did it once  he can do it again!   Its ours! Ours! We must get the precious! We must get it back! Patience! Patience my love! First we must lead them to her! We lead them to the winding stair. Yes  the stairs and then? Up  up  up the stairs we go until we come to the tunnel. And when they go in  there s no coming out. She s always hungry. She always needs to  feed. She must eat. All she gets is filthy Orcses. And they doesn t taste very nice  does they Precious? No  not very nice at all  my love. She hungers for sweeter meats.   Hobbit meat. And when she throws away the bones and the empty clothes   then we will find it. And take it for Meee! For us. Yes  we meant for us! Gollum  gollum. The precious will be ours once the Hobbitses are dead! Frodo! Frodo! Strider!   Get off him! Aragorn! Frodo! Strider! Into the Mines! Legolas! We now have but one choice  we must face the long dark of Moria. Be on your guard  there are older and fouler things than orcs in the deep places of the world The wealth of Moria is not in gold  or jewels  but Mithril Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that Thorin gave him Aww that was a Kingly gift Yes. I never told him  but its worth was greater than the value of The Shire! Pippin! I ve no memory of this place Are we lost ? Frodo! Come on! Frodo! Come on faster! How far to the nearest crossing ? The Brandywine Bridge  twenty miles. Come on! What do you want ? We re heading for the Prancing Pony. Hobbits! Four hobbits! What s more out of The Shire by your talk! What business brings you to Bree? We wish to at the Inn. Our business is our own. alright young sir  I meant no offence.  My job to ask questions after nightfall. There s talk of strange folk abroad. Can t be too careful Out of the way! Watch where you re walking! Excuse me ? Today is my One Hundred and Eleventh birthday! Happy Birthday! Alas  elevnty-one years is far too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits.  I don t know half of you half as well as I should like and I like less than half of you  half as well as you deserve. Why are they still guarding it? They guard it because they have hope. A faint and fading hope that one day it will flower. That a king will come and this city will be as it once was before it fell into decay.   The old wisdom born out of the west was forsaken. Kings made tombs more splendid than the houses of the living and counted the old names of their descent   dearer than the names of their sons.   Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry or in high  cold towers asking questions of the stars. And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.   The line of Kings failed. The white tree withered. The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men. Mordor. Yes  there it lies. This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow. A storm is coming. This is not the weather of the world. This is a device of Sauron s making. A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host. The Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight  so he covers the face of the sun to ease their passage along the road to war. When the shadow of Mordor reaches this city it will begin. Well  Minas Tirith  very impressive.  So where are off to next? Oh  it s too late for that Peregrin. There s no leaving this city.   Help must come to us. But I know you have something to do with it. Good gracious me! Before you came along we Bagginses were very well thought of. Indeed? We never had any adventures  or did anything unexpected. If you re referring to the incident with the dragon  I was barely involved. All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door. Whatever you did  you ve been officially labelled as a  disturber of the peace.  Oh really? Gandalf! Gandalf! Fireworks Gandalf! Gandalf! Fireworks Gandalf! Hooooraaaay! Gandalf  I m glad you re back. You treacherous little toad! No  no! Master! No Sam! Leave him alone! I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us. Never! Smeagol wouldn t hurt a fly!   Aaaagh he is a horrid  fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol and who makes up nasty lies! You miserable little maggot! I ll stove your head in! Sam! Call me a liar? You re a liar! Waaaah! If you scare him off then we are lost! I don t care! I can t do it Mr Frodo! I won t wait around for him to kill us! I m not sending him away. You don t see it do you? He s a villain. We can t do this by ourselves Sam. Not without a guide. I need you on my side. No I think we are Ssh! Gandalf s thinking Merry! What! I m hungry There s something down there It s Gollum Gollum! He s been following us for three days He escaped the dungeons of Barad-D r! Escaped   or was set loose and now the Ring has drawn him here   He won t ever be rid of his need for it. He hates and loves the Ring  as he hates and loves himself. Smeagol s life is a sad story   Yes   he was once called  before the Ring found him. Before it drove him mad It s a pity Bilbo didnt kill him when he had the chance Pity ? It was pity that stayed Bilbo s hand. Many that live deserve death and many that die  deserve life. Can you give it to them Frodo ? Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgement Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play  yet for good or ill.... before this is over.   The pity of Bilbo  may rule the fate of many I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened. So do all who live to see such times  but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world  Frodo  besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring  in which case you also were meant to have it and that is an encouraging thought. Oh! Its that way Good Evening little masters. What can I do for you ? If you re looking for accomodation  we ve got some nice  cosy hobbit sized rooms available. Always proud to cater to the little folk  Mr err... ? Underhill  my name s Underhill Underhill   yes.. We re friends of Gandalf the Grey. Can you tell him we ve arrived? Gandalf ?  Gandalf ? Oh yes! I remember! Elderly chap! Big grey beard  pointy hat.   Not seen him for six months. What do we do now ? Sam. He ll be here. He ll come. What s that ? This my friend  is a pint! It comes in pints ? hmmmhmmm I m getting one! You ve had a whole half already! That fellow s done nothing but stare at you since we arrived! So am I dear boy.   So am I. No thank you! We don t want any more visitors  well wishers or distant relations! And what about very old friends? Gandalf? Bilbo Baggins. My dear Gandalf! It s good to see you. One hundred and eleven years old who would believe it.   You haven t aged a day! Come on  come in! Welcome  welcome. Oh  here we are. Tea or maybe something a little stronger? I ve got a few bottles of the Old Winyard left  1296  a very good year  almost as old as I am. It was laid down by my father  what say we open one eh? Just tea  thank you. Owwwh! I was expecting you sometime last week. Not that it matters; you come and go as you please. Always have done and always will. I m on your side Mr Frodo I know Sam  I know. Trust me. Come Smeagol. What time is it? I dreamed I saw a great wave climbing over green lands and above the hills. I stood upon the brink. It was utterly dark in the abyss before my feet. A light shone behind me but I could not turn   I could only stand there  waiting. Night changes many thoughts. Sleep Eowyn. Sleep while you can. The stars are veiled. Something stirs in the East  a sleepless malice   The eye of the enemy is moving. What are you doing? Pippin! Pippin! Pippin! Are you mad? I just want to look at it  just one more time. Put it back! Pippin! No! He s remembered No  but the air doesnt smell so foul down here. If in doubt  Meriadoc  always follow your nose. Let me risk a little more light   Behold the great realm and dwarf city of Dwarrowdelf. There s an eye-opener and no mistake Oh! Gimli! No  no   no Here lies Balin  son of Fundin  Lord of Moria.   He is dead then.   Its as I feared. We must move on  we cannot linger. They have taken the Bridge and the second hall. We have barred the gates  but cannot hold them for long. The ground shakes. Drums   Drums in the deep. We cannot get out.   A shadow moves in the dark.   We cannot get out. They are coming. Fool of a Took!   Throw yourself in next time  and rid us of your stupidity! Frodo! Orcs! Get back! and stay close to Gandalf. Excuse me. That man in the corner. Who is he ? He s one of them rangers. They re dangerous folk they are. Wandering the wilds. What his right name is  I ve never heard  but round here  he s known as Strider. Strider Baggins.... Baggins.... Baggins ....Baggins! Baggins! Baggins ? Sure I know a Baggins! He s over there. Frodo Baggins! He s my second cousin once removed on his mother s side   and my third cousin twice removed on his father s side  if you follow me. Pippin! Steady on! Oh! You cannot hide!   I see you!  There is no life in the void   Only death! You draw far too much attention to yourself Mr Underhill! What do you want ? A little more caution from you! That is no trinket you carry! I carry nothing Indeed   I can avoid being seen if I wish. But to disappear entirely That is a rare gift! You ve caught me a bit unprepared I m afraid urm we ve only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle oh and there s some cheese here  oh no that wont do! Urm we ve got raspberry jam  an apple tart   but we ve not much for afters. Oh no we re all right  I ve found some sponge cake!   I can make you some eggs if you   oh . Gandalf? Just tea  thank you. Oh right.   You don t mind if I do  do you? Oh not at all! Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins! I m not at home!   It s the Sackville-Bagginses. I know you re in there! They re after the house!   They ve never forgiven me for living this long. I ve got to get away from these confounded relatives hanging on the bell all day  never giving me a moment s peace.   I want to see mountains again  mountains Gandalf.   And then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book. Oh  tea! So you mean to go through with your plan then? Yes  yes  it s all in hand. All the arrangements are made.   Oh  thank you. Frodo suspects something. Of course he does  he s a Baggins  not some blockheaded Bracegirdle from Hardbottle. You will tell him wont you? Pippin! He is here! I see you! Pippin! Help! Gandalf help! Help him! Pippin! Fool of a Took! No. Look at me. Gandalf  forgive me! Look at me! What did you see? A tree  there was a white tree in a courtyard of stone. It was dead.  The city was burning. Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw? They have a cave troll! Agh! Let them come There s one dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath. Pull! Who are you ? Are you frightened? Yes Not nearly frightened enough. I know what hunts you. Let him go! Or I ll have you Longshanks! You have a stout heart little hobbit! But that will not save you. You can no longer wait for the wizard Frodo. They re coming What are they ? They were once men. Great Kings of Men. The Sauron the Deciever gave to them nine rings of power. Blinded by their greed they took them without question. One by one falling into darkness  Now they are slaves to his will. They are the Nazg l. Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead. At all times they feel the presence of the Ring   Drawn to the power of the One   They will never stop hunting you. Where are you taking us ? Into the wild How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf ? I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer  but feel fouler. He s foul enough We have no choice but to trust him Yes  yes. He s very fond of you. I know  he d probably come with me if I asked him to. I think in his heart Frodo s still in love with the Shire  the woods  the fields and the little rivers. I am old Gandalf. I know I don t look it  but I m beginning to feel it in my heart.   I feel thin  sort of stretched like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a holiday  a very long holiday. And I don t expect that I shall return. In fact  I mean not to. Old Toby  the finest weed in the Southfarthing. Gandalf my old friend  this will be a night to remember. I saw  I saw him!   I could hear his voice in my head. And what did you tell him? Speak! He asked me my name. I didn t answer. He hurt me! What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring? There was no lie in Pippin s eyes. A fool but an honest fool he remains. He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.  We ve been strangely fortunate. Pippin saw in the Palantir a glimpse of the enemy s plan. Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith. His defeat at Helm s Deep showed our enemy one thing.   He knows the Heir of Elendil has come forth   Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still. Strength enough  perhaps  to challenge him. Sauron fears this. He will not risk the peoples of Middle Earth uniting under one banner.   He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground   before he sees a King return to the throne of men. If the beacons of Gondor are lit Rohan must be ready for war. Tell me! Why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours? What do we owe Gondor? I will go! No! They must be warned! But where is he leading us ? To Rivendell Master Gamgee. To the House of Elrond. D you hear that! Rivendell! We re going to see the elves! Gentlemen! We do not stop  til nightfall What about breakfast ? You ve already had it We ve had one yes. What about second breakfast ? Don t think he knows about second breakfast Pippin What about elvenses ? Luncheon  Afternoon Tea  Dinner ? Supper! He knows about them  doesnt he ? I wouldn t count on it Pippin! They will be.   You must come to Minas Tirith by another road. Follow the river. Look to the black ships.   Understand this  things are now in motion that cannot be undone. I ride for Minas Tirith   and I wont be going alone. Of all the Hobbits  Peregrin Took  you are the worst! Hurry! Hurry! Where are we going? Why did you look? Why do you always have to look? I don t know  I can t help it. You never can! I m sorry alright? I won t do it again. Don t you understand? The enemy thinks you have the ring! He is going to be looking for you Pip. They have to get you out of here. And you? You re coming with me?   Merry? Come on! How far is Minas Tirith? Three days ride as the Nazg l flies. And you d better hope we don t have one of those on our tail. Here  something for the road. The last of the Longbottom Leaf? I know you ve run out. You smoke too much Pippin. But  we ll see each other soon? Wont we? I don t know! I don t know whats going to happen. Merry? Run  Shadowfax show us the meaning of haste. Merry! Merry! He s always followed me everywhere I went since before we were tweens. I would get him into the worst sort of trouble but I was always there to get him out. Now he s gone.   Just like Frodo and Sam. One thing I v learnt about Hobbits: They are a most hardy folk. Foolhardy maybe. He s a Took! '"
