      "16 Gandalf strikes his staff onto the bridge. As the Balrog steps forward, the bridge collapses from under it and the demon plunges backward into the chasm. Gandalf, exhausted, leans on his staff and watches the Balrog fall then turns to follow the others. At the last minute, the flaming whip lashes up from the depths of the abyss and winds around Gandalf's ankle, dragging him over the edge. He clings onto the bridge but is straining to keep his grip.\n",

      "26 Gandalf falls after the Balrog and grabs hold of his sword Glamdring on his way down. As they continue to plunge into the depths, Gandalf hacks away at the Balrog even as it thrashes and bounces off the walls. They continue to plunge at great speed, sometimes with Gandalf clinging to the horn of the demon. The battling pair then falls into an enormous cavern and plunges into the water. Just then Frodo awakens as if from a nightmare.\n",

      "49 Gollum creeps closer and closer.\n",
      "50 Gollum reaches out his hand towards the hobbits. Suddenly the hobbits spring up, grab hold of Gollum's arms and pull him down. Amidst the struggle, Gollum wriggles loose and leaps onto Frodo. As Frodo falls back, the chain and Ring around his neck is revealed and Gollum jumps straight for the Ring. Sam tries to grab at him but is knocked away. Gollum now jumps on top of Frodo and tries to reach for the Ring even as Frodo grabs his hands and tries to push him away. Gollum's cheeks puff with exertion as he struggles with Frodo, his enormous eyes fixed on the Ring. Sam grabs hold of Gollum again and tears him away from Frodo. Gollum then turns around and bites Sam on the shoulder, wriggles around and clasps his arms around Sam's neck and legs around his waist in a death grip. Frodo unsheathes Sting and holds it to Gollum's throat.\n",
      "51 menacingly\n",
      "52 Slowly, Gollum loosens his grip on Sam and as the latter disentangles himself, Gollum wails. In the next scene, Gollum is being dragged with Sam's Elvish rope around his neck, wailing and writhing in pain.\n",
      "55 Sam tugs fiercely at the rope. Gollum cries some more and collapses onto his back. Sam turns to Frodo in dismay.\n",

      "80 Suddenly, an Uruk-hai puts up his hand and signals a stop.\n",
      "82 sniffs the air\n",
      "83 quietly to himself\n",
      "85 The Uruk-hai quicken their pace. Pippin struggles to reach his Elven brooch with his teeth. He then tears it off his cloak and drops it onto the ground. A foot stomps onto the brooch but it remains unbroken and visible on the grass.\n",

      "107 Camera pans upwards along the height of the tower of Barad-dur until the flaming Eye is in view.\n",

      "132 Eowyn runs hastily up the stairs to the Golden Hall and enters a bedchamber. She runs to the bed.\n",
      "134 Theodred seems to hear her call but is unable to respond. He has a bloody gash on the side of his head. Eomer nods to Eowyn in the direction of Theodred's torso. Eowyn draws back the covers and upon seeing Theodred's fatal wound, her lips tighten and eyes close. She looks up to catch Eomer's eye.\n",

      "13 I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the Flame of Anor!\n",
      "15 Argh! Go back to the shadow. The Dark Fire will not avail you, Flame of Udun!  YOU SHALL NOT... PASS!!!\n",
      "17 Argh!\n",
      "19 No! No!\n",

      "27 Gandalf!\n",
      "28 What is it, Mr. Frodo?\n",
      "29 Nothing. Just a dream.\n",
      "31 Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer, and the one place we're trying to get to. It's just where we can'tt get. Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost. I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.\n",
      "32 He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam... but they did.\n",
      "34 Mr. Frodo? It's the Ring, isn't it?\n",
      "35 It's getting heavier.\n",
      "36 What food have we got left?\n",
      "37 Well, let me see.  Oh yes, lovely Lembas bread. And look!  More lembas bread.\n",
      "39 I don't usually hold with foreign food, but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.\n",
      "40 Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it Sam?\n",
      "42 Those rain clouds might.\n",
      "44 This looks strangely familiar.\n",
      "45 It's because we've been here before! We're going in circles.\n",
      "46 Ah! What's that 'orrid stink? I'll warrant there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you smell it?\n",
      "47 Yes. I can smell it.  We're not alone.\n",
      "49 The thieves! The thieves! The filthy little thieves! Where is it? Where isss it? They stole it from us. My preciousss.  Curse them! We hates them! It's ours, it is... and we wantssss it!\n",
      "51 This is Sting. You've seen it before, haven't you... Gollum! Release him or I'll cut your throat!\n",
      "53 It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty Elves twisted it. Take it off us!\n",
      "54 Quiet you!\n",
      "56 It's hopeless! Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket! Let's just tie him up and leave him.\n",
      "57 No! That would kill us! Kill us!\n",
      "58 It's no more than you deserve!\n",
      "59 Maybe he does deserve to die, but now that I see him, I do pity him.\n",
      "60 We be nice to them if they be nice to us. Take it off us. We swears to do what you wants. We swears.\n",
      "61 There's no promise you can make that I can trust.\n",
      "62 We swears to serve the master of the preciousss. We swears on... on the precious. *Gollum. Gollum.*\n",
      "63 The Ring is treacherous. It will hold you to your word.\n",
      "64 Yes... on the preciousss. On the preciousss.\n",
      "65 I don't believe you!  Get down! I said, down!\n",
      "67 Sam!\n",
      "68 He's trying to trick us! We let him go he'll throttle us in our sleep!\n",
      "70 You know the way to Mordor?\n",
      "71 Yes...\n",
      "72 You've been there before?\n",
      "73 Yes...\n",
      "75 You will lead us to the Black Gate.\n",

      "81 What is it? What do you smell?\n",
      "82 Man-flesh.\n",
      "83 Aragorn!\n",
      "84 They've picked up our trail! Let's move!\n",
      "87 Their pace has quickened.  They must have caught our scent. Hurry!\n",
      "88 Come on, Gimli!\n",
      "89 Three days' and nights' pursuit. No food. No rest. And no sign of our quarry but what bare rock can tell.\n",
      "91 Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.\n",
      "92 They may yet be alive.\n",
      "93 Less than a day ahead of us. Come!\n",
      "95 Come, Gimli! We are gaining on them!\n",
      "96 I am wasted on cross-country! We dwarves are natural sprinters! Very dangerous over short distances!\n",
      "99 Rohan. Home of the horse-lords. There is something strange at work here. Some evil gives speed to these creatures, sets its will against us.\n",
      "101 Legolas, what do your Elf eyes see?\n",
      "102 The Uruks turn northeast. They're taking the hobbits to Isengard!\n",
      "103 Saruman.\n",
      "106 The world is changing.  Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor? To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?\n",
      "108 Together, my lord Sauron, we shall rule this Middle-earth.\n",
      "110 The old world will burn in the fires of industry. The forests will fall. A new order will rise. We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc. We have only to remove those who oppose us.\n",
      "112 The horsemen took your land. They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.\n",
      "113 Murderers!\n",
      "114 Take back the lands they stole from you! Burn every village!\n",
      "115 Argh!!\n",
      "117 It will begin in Rohan. Too long have these peasants stood against you. But no more.\n",
      "119 Eothain! Eothain! You take your sister. You'll go faster with just two.\n",
      "120 Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf, he is too big for him!\n",
      "121 Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm. Do you understand me?\n",
      "122 Yes, Ma!\n",
      "123 I don't wanna leave! I don't wanna go, Mama!\n",
      "124 Freda, I will find you there.\n",
      "126 Quickly!\n",
      "128 Go child!\n",
      "130 Rohan, my lord, is ready to fall.\n",
      "133 Theodred!\n",
      "136 Your son is badly wounded, my lord.\n",
      "137 That is a lie!  Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.\n",
      "138 Grima. Grima. My son...? Grima...?\n",
      "139 Orcs are roaming freely across our lands. Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at will. Orcs bearing the white hand of Saruman.\n",
      "140 Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind. Can you not see? Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent, your war-mongering.\n",
      "141 War-mongering?\n",
      "143 How long is it since Saruman bought you? What was the promised price, Grima? When all the men are dead you will take your share of the treasure?\n",
      "145 Too long have you watched my sister, too long have you haunted her steps.\n",
      "147 You see much Eomer, Son of Eomund. Too much.  You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan. Under pain of death!\n",
      "150 Keep breathing! That's the key! Breathe! Ho!\n",
      "151 They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.\n",
      "153 We're not going no further till we've had a breather!\n",
      "154 Get a fire going!\n",
      "156 Merry! Merry!\n",
      "157 I think... we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.\n",
      "159 What's making that noise?\n",
      "160 It's the trees.\n",
      "161 What?\n",
      "162 Do you remember the Old Forest? On the borders of Buckland? Folk used to say that there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall... and come alive.\n",
      "163 Alive?\n",
      "164 Trees that could whisper. Talk to each other. Even move.\n",
      "165 I'm starving. We ain't 'ad nothin' but maggoty bread for three stinkin' days!\n",
      "166 Yeah. Why can'tt we have some meat?  What about them? They're fresh.\n",
      "167 They are not for eating!\n",
      "168 What about their legs? They don't need those. Ooh! They look tasty!\n",
      "169 Get back, scum!\n",
      "171 Carve them up!\n",
      "172 Just a mouth full.\n",
      "173 No!\n",
      "175 Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys!!\n",
      "177 Pippin, let's go.\n",
      "179 Go on, call for help. Squeal! No one's gonna save you now!\n",
      "181 Pippin!\n",
      "183 ARGH!!!\n",
      "186 A red sun rises. Blood has been spilled this night.\n",
      "188 Riders of Rohan, what news from the Mark?\n",
      "190 What business does an Elf, a man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speak quickly!\n",
      "191 Give me your name, Horsemaster, and I shall give you mine.\n",
      "193 I would cut off your head, Dwarf, if it stood but a little higher from the ground.\n",
      "195 You would die before your stroke fell!\n",
      "197 I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This is Gimli, son of Gloin and Legolas of the Woodland realm. We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.\n",
      "198 Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.  Not even his own kin.\n",
      "200 Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands. My company are those loyal to Rohan. And for that, we are banished. The White Wizard is cunning. He walks here and there, they say, as an old man, hooded and cloaked. And everywhere his spies slip past our nets.\n",
      "201 We are not spies. We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain. They've taken two of our friends captive.\n",
      "202 But there were two hobbits. Did you see two hobbits with them?\n",
      "203 They would be small, only children to your eyes.\n",
      "204 We left none alive. We piled the carcasses and burned them.\n",
      "205 Dead?\n",
      "206 I am sorry.\n",
      "209 Look for your friends. But do not trust to hope, it has forsaken these lands.  We ride north!\n",
      "211 It's one of their wee belts.\n",
      "212 Hiro 'th' ab 'wanath... (May they find peace in death)\n",
      "213 AAARRGGHH!!!\n",
      "214 We failed them.\n",
      "216 A hobbit lay here, and the other.  They crawled.\n",
      "218 Their hands were bound.  Their bonds were cut.\n",
      "219 They ran over here. They were followed.\n",
      "221 The belt!\n",
      "223 Run!\n",
      "224 The tracks lead away from the battle...  into Fangorn Forest.\n",
      "226 Fangorn. What madness drove them in there?\n",
      "229 Did we lose him?  I think we lost him.\n",
      "231 I'm gonna rip out your filthy little innards! Come here!\n",
      "233 Trees! Climb a tree!\n",
      "235 He's gone.\n",
      "237 Merry!\n",
      "239 Hooooo...\n",
      "240 Argh!!\n",
      "242 Let's put a maggot-hole in your belly.\n",
      "243 Run, Merry!\n",
      "245 Little Orcs! Burarum...\n",
      "246 It's talking, Merry. The tree is talking!\n",
      "247 Tree?! I am no tree. I am an Ent.\n",
      "248 A treeherder! A shepherd of the forest.\n",
      "249 Don't talk to it, Merry. Don't encourage it.\n",
      "250 Treebeard, some call me.\n",
      "251 And whose side are you on?\n",
      "252 Side? I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc. Nobody cares for the woods anymore.\n",
      "253 We're not Orcs. We're Hobbits!\n",
      "254 Hobbits? Never heard of a hobbit before. Sounds like Orc mischief to me!  They come with fire, they come with axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning! Destroyers and usurpers, curse them!\n",
      "255 No, you don't understand. We're Hobbits... Halflings! Shirefolk!\n",
      "256 Maybe you are and maybe you aren't. The White Wizard will know.\n",
      "257 The White Wizard?\n",
      "258 Saruman.\n",
      "262 See, see, we have led you out! Hurry hobbitses hurry. Very lucky we find you.\n",
      "264 Nice hobbit.\n",
      "266 Whoa, it's a bog! He's led us into a swamp!\n",
      "267 A swamp, yes, yes. Come, master. We will take you on safe paths through the mist. Come, hobbits, come. We go quickly.\n",
      "269 I found it, I did. The way through the marshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it. They go round for miles and miles. Come quickly. Swift and quick as shadows we must be.\n",
      "271 There are dead things! Dead faces in the water!\n",
      "272 All dead. All rotten. Elves and men and orcses. A great battle long ago.  The Dead Marshes. Yes, yes that is their name. This way. Don't follow the lights.\n",
      "274 Ohh!\n",
      "275 Careful now, or hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.\n",
      "277 Frodo!\n",
      "279 Gollum...\n",
      "280 Don't follow the lights!\n",
      "281 Mr. Frodo! Are you alright?\n",
      "285 Sooo bright. Sooo beautiful.  our preciousss...\n",
      "286 What did you say?\n",
      "287 Master should be resting. Master needs to keep up his strength.\n",
      "288 Who are you?\n",
      "289 Mustn't ask us. Not its business. *Gollum, Gollum*\n",
      "290 Gandalf told me you were one of the River Folk.\n",
      "291 Cold be heart and hand and bone. Cold be travellers far from home.\n",
      "292 He said your life was a sad story.\n",
      "293 They do not see what lies ahead, when sun has failed and moon is dead.\n",
      "294 You were not so very different from a hobbit once, were you... Smeagol?\n",
      "295 What did you call me?\n",
      "296 That was your name once, wasn't it? A long time ago.\n",
      "297 My name... My name... S... S...Smeagol.\n",
      "299 Argh!!\n",
      "300 Black Riders!\n",
      "301 Hide! Hide!\n",
      "302 Argh!\n",
      "304 Argh!!\n",
      "305 C'mon Frodo! C'mon!\n",
      "307 Quick! They will see us! They will see us!\n",
      "308 I thought they were dead!\n",
      "309 Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No.\n",
      "311 Wraiths! Wraiths on wings! They are calling for it. They are calling for the preciousss.\n",
      "313 Mr. Frodo! It's alright. I'm here.\n",
      "315 Hurry, hobbits. The Black Gate is very close.\n",
      "318 Ptui! Orc blood.\n",
      "319 These are strange tracks.\n",
      "320 The air is so close in here.\n",
      "321 This forest is old. Very old. Full of memory... and anger.\n",
      "323 The trees are speaking to each other.\n",
      "324 Gimli!\n",
      "325 Huh?\n",
      "326 Lower your axe.\n",
      "327 Oh.\n",
      "328 Aragorn, nad n' ennas! (Something is out there.)\n",
      "329 Man cenich? (What do you see?)\n",
      "331 The White Wizard approaches.\n",
      "332 Do not let him speak. He will put a spell on us.\n",
      "334 We must be quick.\n",
      "336 You are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits.\n",
      "337 Where are they?\n",
      "338 They passed this way the day before yesterday. They met someone they did not expect. Does that comfort you?\n",
      "339 Who are you? Show yourself!\n",
      "341 It cannot be. You fell.\n",
      "342 Through fire and water.  From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak, I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.\n",
      "344 Until at last, I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.\n",
      "346 Darkness took me. And I strayed out of thought and time.  Stars wheeled overhead and everyday was as long as a life-age of the earth. But it was not the end. I felt life in me again.\n",
      "348 I've been sent back until my task is done.\n",
      "349 Gandalf!\n",
      "350 Gandalf? Yes... That's what they used to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was my name.\n",
      "351 Gandalf!\n",
      "352 I am Gandalf the White.  And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.\n",
      "354 One stage of your journey is over, another begins. War has come to Rohan. We must ride to Edoras with all speed.\n",
      "356 That is one of the Mearas, unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.\n",
      "358 Shadowfax.  He's the lord of all horses and he's been my friend through many dangers.\n",
      "362 My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain. I told Gandalf I would keep you safe and safe is where I'll keep you. The trees have grown wild and dangerous. Anger festers in their hearts. They will harm you if they can. There are too few of us now. Too few of us Ents left to manage them.\n",
      "365 The Black Gate of Mordor.\n",
      "367 Oh save us. My ol' Gaffer'd have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.\n",
      "368 Master says to show him the way into Mordor, so good Smeagol does. Master says so.\n",
      "369 I did.\n",
      "371 That's it then. We cannot get past that.\n",
      "373 Look! The gate, it's opening! I can see a way down.\n",
      "375 Sam, no!\n",
      "376 Argh!!\n",
      "378 Master!\n",
      "380 I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.\n",
      "381 I know, Mr Frodo. I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.\n",
      "383 Now!\n",
      "385 No! No, no master! They catch you! They catch you! Don't take it to him! He wants the preciousss. Always he's looking for it! And the preciousss is wanting to go back to him. But we mustn't let him have it.\n",
      "387 No!  There's another way. More secret. A dark way.\n",
      "388 Why haven't you spoken of this before?!\n",
      "389 Because Master did not ask!\n",
      "390 He's up to something.\n",
      "391 Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?\n",
      "392 Yes. There is a path, and some stairs, and then...a tunnel.\n",
      "393 He's led us this far, Sam.\n",
      "394 Mr. Frodo, no.\n",
      "395 He's been true to his word.\n",
      "396 No!\n",
      "397 Lead the way, Smeagol.\n",
      "398 Good Smeagol always helps.\n",
      "401 Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan, whose mind is overthrown. Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.\n",
      "404 Will you not go to him?  Will you do nothing?\n",
      "406 Be careful what you say. Do not look for welcome here.\n",
      "410 Oh, he ... he must have died sometime in the night. What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.\n",
      "412 I understand his passing is hard to accept, especially now that your brother has deserted you.\n",
      "413 Leave me alone, snake!\n",
      "414 Oh, but you are alone! Who knows what you have spoken to the darkness. In bitter watches of the night, when all your life seems to shrink, the walls of your bower closing in about you, like a hutch to trammel some wild thing in.\n",
      "416 So fair, so cold, like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.\n",
      "418 Your words are poison!\n",
      "420 You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.\n",
      "422 Ah.\n",
      "423 I cannot allow you before Theoden-King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order of Grima Wormtongue.\n",
      "425 Your staff.\n",
      "426 Hmm?  Oh. You would not part an old man from his walking stick?\n",
      "428 My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming. He's a herald of woe.\n",
      "429 The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, Theoden King.\n",
      "431 He's not welcome.\n",
      "432 Why should I welcome you, Gandalf Stormcrow?\n",
      "433 A just question, my liege.  Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear. Lathspell spell I name him. Ill news is an ill guest.\n",
      "434 Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind you teeth. I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm!\n",
      "435 His staff!  I told you to take the wizard's staff!\n",
      "437 Theoden, son of Thengel, too long have you sat in the shadows.\n",
      "439 I would stay still, if I were you.\n",
      "440 Hearken to me! I release you from the spell.\n",
      "441 Hahahhhahahahah!  You have no power here, Gandalf the Grey!\n",
      "443 Argh!\n",
      "444 I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.\n",
      "446 Wait.\n",
      "447 If I go. . . Theoden dies.\n",
      "449 You did not kill me, you will not kill him!\n",
      "450 Rohan is mine!\n",
      "451 Be gone!!\n",
      "453 I know your face. Eowyn Eowyn.\n",
      "455 Gandalf?\n",
      "456 Breathe the free air again, my friend.\n",
      "458 Dark have been my dreams of late.\n",
      "459 Your fingers would remember their old strength better... if they grasped your sword.\n",
      "461 Argh!  I've only ever served you, my lord!\n",
      "462 Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!\n",
      "463 Send me not from your side.\n",
      "465 No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go. Enough blood has been spilled on his account.\n",
      "467 Get out of my way!\n",
      "468 Hail, Theoden king!\n",
      "470 Where is Theodred? Where is my son?\n",
      "473 Simbelmyn'. Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.  Now it shall cover the grave of my son. Alas, that these evil days should be mine. The young perish and the old linger. That I should live to see the last days of my house.\n",
      "474 Theodred's death was not of your making.\n",
      "475 No parent should have to bury their child.\n",
      "477 He was strong in life. His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers. Westu h'l. Fer'u, Theodred, Fer'u. (Be-thou well. Go-thou, Theodred, go-thou.)\n",
      "479 They had no warning. They were unarmed. Now the wildmen are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go. Rick, cot and tree.\n",
      "480 Where's mama?\n",
      "481 Shh...\n",
      "482 This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash. All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron. Ride out and meet him head on. Draw him away from your women and children.  You must fight.\n",
      "483 You have two thousand good men riding north as we speak. Eomer is loyal to you. His men will return and fight for their king.\n",
      "484 They will be three hundred leagues from here by now. Eomer cannot help us. I know what it is that you want of me. But I will not bring further death to my people. I will not risk open war.\n",
      "486 Open war is upon you. Whether you would risk it or not.\n",
      "487 When last I looked, Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.\n",
      "489 Then what is the king's decision?\n",
      "491 By order of the king, the city must empty. We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep. Do not burden yourselves with treasures. Take only what provisions you need.\n",
      "493 Helm's Deep! They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight. Who will defend them if not their king.\n",
      "494 He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people. Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.\n",
      "496 There is no way out of that ravine. Theoden is walking into a trap. He thinks he's leading them to safety. What they will get is a massacre. Theoden has a strong will but I fear for him. I fear for the survival of Rohan. He will need you before the end, Aragorn. The people of Rohan will need you. The defences HAVE to hold.\n",
      "497 They will hold.\n",
      "498 The Grey Pilgrim... that's what they used to call me. Three hundred lives of men I've walked this earth and now I have no time. With luck, my search will not be in vain. Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the East.\n",
      "499 Go.\n",
      "503 You have some skill with a blade.\n",
      "505 Women of this country learned long ago: Those without swords may still die upon them. I fear neither death nor pain.\n",
      "506 What do you fear, my lady?\n",
      "507 A cage. To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them and all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.\n",
      "508 You are a daughter of kings, a shieldmaiden of Rohan.  I do not think that would be your fate.\n",
      "512 Theoden will not stay at Edoras. It's vulnerable, he knows this. He will expect an attack on the city. They will flee to Helm's Deep, the great fortress of Rohan. It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains. They will be slow. They will have women and children with them.\n",
      "514 Send out your warg riders.\n",
      "518 Hey Stinker! Don't go getting too far ahead!\n",
      "519 Why do you do that?\n",
      "520 What?\n",
      "521 Call him names; run him down all the time.\n",
      "522 Because ... because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in 'im but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he wants. It's all he cares about.\n",
      "523 You have no idea what it did to him. What it's still doing to him.  I want to help him, Sam...\n",
      "524 Why?\n",
      "525 Because I have to believe he can come back.\n",
      "526 You can'tt save him, Mr. Frodo.\n",
      "527 What do you know about it? Nothing!\n",
      "529 I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that.\n",
      "530 I do. It's the Ring. You can't take your eyes off it. I've seen you. You're not eating. You barely sleep. It's taken a hold of you, Mr Frodo. You have to fight it!\n",
      "531 I know what I have to do Sam. The Ring was entrusted to me! It's my task! Mine! My own!\n",
      "532 Can't you hear yourself? Don't you know who you sound like?\n",
      "536 We wants it. We needs it. Must have the precioussss. They stole it from us. Sneaky little hobbitsesss. Wicked, trickssssy, falssse!\n",
      "537 No! Not Master.\n",
      "538 Yes, precious. False. They will cheat you, hurt you, lie.\n",
      "539 Master's my friend.\n",
      "540 You don't have any friends. Nobody likes YOU...\n",
      "541 Not listening. I'm not listening.\n",
      "542 You're a liar and a thief.\n",
      "543 Nope.\n",
      "544 Murderer!\n",
      "545 Go away.\n",
      "546 Go away!  HAHAHAHA!!\n",
      "547 I hate you. I hate you!\n",
      "548 Where would you be without me? *Gollum, gollum*. I saved us. It was me. We survived because of me!\n",
      "549 Not anymore.\n",
      "550 What did you say?\n",
      "551 Master looks after us now. We don't need you.\n",
      "552 What?\n",
      "553 Leave now and never come back.\n",
      "554 No!!\n",
      "555 Leave now and never come back!\n",
      "556 Arrrgh!!!\n",
      "557 LEAVE. NOW. AND. NEVER. COME. BACK!\n",
      "559 We... we told him to go away! And away he goes, preciousss.  Gone, gone, gone! Smeagol is free!\n",
      "561 Look! Look! See what Smeagol finds! Hehehe! Hahaha!\n",
      "563 They are young. They are tender. They are nice. Yes they are! Eat them! Eat them!\n",
      "565 You'll make him sick, you will, behaving like that!  There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.\n",
      "567 Argh!! What's it doing! Stupid fat hobbit! It ruins it!\n",
      "568 What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat on them.\n",
      "570 What we need is a few good taters.\n",
      "571 What's taters, preciousss? What's taters uh?\n",
      "572 PO-TAY-TOES! Boil them. Mash them. Stick them in a stew. Lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish....\n",
      "573 Pbbbttt!!\n",
      "574 Even you couldn't say no to that.\n",
      "575 Oh yes we could! Spoil nice fish...  Give it to usss rrraw... and wrrriggling!  You keep nasty chips.\n",
      "576 You're hopeless.\n",
      "578 Mr. Frodo?\n",
      "580 Who are they?\n",
      "581 Wicked men. Servants of Sauron. They are called to Mordor. The Dark One is gathering all armies to him. It won't be long now. He will soon be ready.\n",
      "582 Ready to do what?\n",
      "583 To make his war. The last war that will cover all the world in shadow.\n",
      "584 We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.\n",
      "585 Mr Frodo! Look! It's an Oliphaunt!\n",
      "587 No one at home will believe this...\n",
      "589 Smeagol?\n",
      "591 We've lingered here too long. Come on, Sam!\n",
      "593 Ah!\n",
      "595 Bind their hands.\n",
      "598 It's true you don't see many Dwarf women. And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance, haha that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.\n",
      "600 It's the beards....\n",
      "601 And this, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women. And that dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground!\n",
      "602 Hahahaha!!\n",
      "603 Hehehe! Which is of course ridiculous. Whoa!!\n",
      "605 It's alright, it's alright. Nobody panic. That was deliberate. It was deliberate.\n",
      "607 The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane' It is mine to give to whom I will... Like my heart. Go to sleep...\n",
      "609 I am asleep. This is a dream.\n",
      "610 Then it is a good dream. Sleep.\n",
      "612 Min l' pennich nin i aur hen telitha. (You told me once that this day would come.)\n",
      "613 ' i vethed... n' i onnad. Boe bedich go Frodo. Han b'd l'n. (This is not the end... it is the beginning. You must go with Frodo. That is your path.)\n",

      "623 Our time here is ending. Arwen ...s time is ending. Let her go. Let her take the ship into the west. Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands. There it will be evergreen.\n",
      "624 But never more than a memory.\n",
      "625 I will not leave my daughter here to die.\n",
      "626 She stays because she still has hope.\n",
      "627 She stays for YOU! She belongs with her people!\n",
      "629 Idhren emmen menna gui ethwel. Hae o auth a n'r a naeth. (You have a chance for another life. Away from war... grief... despair.)\n",
      "630 Why are you saying this?\n",
      "631 I am mortal; you are Elfkind. It was a dream, Arwen, nothing more.\n",
      "633 This belongs to you.\n",
      "634 It was a gift. Keep it.\n",
      "636 She is sailing to the Undying Lands, with all that is left of her kin.\n",
      "638 What is it? Hama?\n",
      "640 I'm not sure.\n",
      "642 Wargs!\n",
      "644 Argh!  A scout!\n",
      "645 What is it? What do you see?\n",
      "646 Wargs! We are under attack!\n",
      "648 Get them out of here!\n",
      "649 All riders to the head of the column!\n",
      "650 Come on, get me up here, I'm a rider! Argh!\n",
      "652 You must lead the people to Helm's Deep. And make haste!\n",
      "653 I can fight!\n",
      "654 No! You must do this... for me.\n",
      "656 Follow me! Yah!\n",
      "657 Forward. I mean, charge forward! March forward!  That's it! Go on!\n",
      "658 Make for the lower ground! Stick together!\n",
      "661 Argh!!\n",
      "662 CHARGE!!\n",
      "664 Bring your pretty face to my axe!\n",
      "666 Argh! That one counts as mine!\n",
      "668 Argh! Stinking creature. Argh!\n",
      "670 Ooh..!\n",
      "672 Oooh!!\n",
      "674 Aragorn!\n",
      "675 Aragorn?\n",
      "677 Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.\n",
      "678 He's  dead.  Took a little tumble off the cliff.\n",
      "679 You lie!\n",
      "681 Get the wounded on horses. The wolves of Isengard will return. Leave the dead.\n",
      "683 Come.\n",
      "687 Helm's Deep! At last! There it is!\n",
      "688 We're safe, my lady! Thank you!\n",
      "690 Mama!\n",
      "691 Eothain! Freda!\n",
      "693 Make way for Theoden!\n",
      "694 Sire!\n",
      "695 Make way for the king!\n",
      "697 So few. So few of you have returned.\n",
      "698 Our people are safe. We have paid for it with many lives.\n",
      "699 My lady...\n",
      "700 Lord Aragorn, where is he?\n",
      "701 He fell...\n",
      "705 Draw all our forces behind the wall. Bar the gate, and set a watch on the surround.\n",
      "706 What of those who cannot fight, my lord? The women and children?\n",
      "707 Get them into the caves.  Saruman's arm would have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.\n",
      "709 Helm's Deep has one weakness. Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.\n",
      "711 How? How can fire undo stone? What kind of device could bring down the wall?\n",
      "713 If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.\n",
      "715 Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning, thousands to storm the keep.\n",
      "716 Tens of thousands.\n",
      "717 But, my lord, there is no such force.\n",
      "719 A new power is rising. Its victory is at hand!\n",
      "721 This night, the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan! March to Helms Deep! Leave none alive!\n",
      "723 To war!!\n",
      "725 There will be no dawn for Men.\n",
      "729 Look! There's smoke to the south!\n",
      "730 There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.\n",
      "731 Isengard?\n",
      "733 There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods. But now he has a mind of metal and wheels. He no longer cares for growing things.\n",
      "735 What is it?\n",
      "736 It's Saruman's army! The war has started.\n",
      "739 May the grace of the Valar protect you.\n",
      "741 Brego.\n",
      "743 Arwen.\n",
      "745 Tollen i l'. I chair gwannar na Valannor. Si bado, no c'rar. (Arwen, it is time. The ships are leaving for Valinor. Go now... before it is too late.)\n",
      "746 I have made my choice.\n",
      "747 He is not coming back. Why do you linger here when there is no hope?\n",
      "748 There is still hope.\n",
      "749 If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted. If Sauron is defeated, and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true, you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality. Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time, Aragorn will die.\n",
      "751 And there will be no comfort for you. No comfort to ease the pain of his passing. He will come to death, an image of the splendor of the kings of men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.\n",
      "753 But you, my daughter, you will linger on in darkness and in doubt. As nightfall in winter that comes without a star. Here you will dwell, bound to your grief, under the fading trees, until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.\n",
      "755 Arwen... there is nothing for you here, only death.\n",
      "757 A im, '-'erin veleth l'n? (Do I not also have your love?)\n",
      "758 Gerich meleth n'n, ada. (You have my love, father)\n",
      "761 I amar prestar aen... han mathon ne nen, han mathon ne chae a han nostan ned gwilith. (The world has changed... I feel it in the water, I feel it in the earth, I smell it in the air.) The power of the enemy is growing.  Sauron will use his puppet Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan. Isengard has been unleashed.  The eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor, the last free kingdom of men.  His war on this country will come swiftly. He senses the Ring is close. The strength of the Ringbearer is failing. In his heart, Frodo begins to understand.  The quest will claim his life. You know this. You have foreseen it. It is the risk we all took.\n",
      "763 In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong. It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of men.\n",
      "765 Men, who are so easily seduced by its power. The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hands, take the Ring for his own and the world will fall. It is close now, so close to achieving its goal.\n",
      "767 For Sauron will have dominion of all life on this Earth, even unto the ending of the world. The time of the Elves is over.\n",
      "769 Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate? Do we let them stand alone?\n",
      "772 What news?\n",
      "773 Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan. Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.  But we must look to our own borders. Faramir, Orcs are on the move. Sauron is marshalling an army. Easterlings and Southrons are passing through the Black Gate.\n",
      "774 How many?\n",
      "775 Some thousands. More come every day.\n",
      "776 Who's covering the river to the north?\n",
      "777 We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath, but if the city is attacked, we won't hold it.\n",
      "778 Saruman attacks from Isengard. Sauron from Mordor. The fight will come to men on both fronts. Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us soon. And he will strike hard. He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.\n",
      "780 My men tell me that you are Orc spies.\n",
      "781 Spies?! Now wait just a minute!\n",
      "782 Well if you're not spies, then who are you?\n",
      "784 Speak.\n",
      "785 We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.\n",
      "786 Your bodyguard?\n",
      "787 His gardener.\n",
      "788 And where is your skulking friend? That gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured look.\n",
      "789 There was no other.\n",
      "791 We set out from Rivendell with seven companions. One we lost in Moria. Two were my kin. A Dwarf there was also, and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.\n",
      "792 You're a friend of Boromir?\n",
      "793 Yes... for my part.\n",
      "794 It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.\n",
      "795 Dead? How? When?\n",
      "796 As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.  He was my brother.\n",
      "799 Captain Faramir.  We found the third one.\n",
      "801 You must come with me. Now.\n",
      "803 Down there.\n",
      "805 To enter the forbidden pool bears the penalty of death.  They wait for my command.\n",
      "807 Shall I shoot?\n",
      "809 The rock and pool is nice and cool, so juicy sweet! I only wish  to catch a fish , so juicy sweet!\n",
      "811 Wait!  This creature is bound to me. And I to him. He is our guide. Please, let me go down to him.\n",
      "813 Smeagol.  Master is here. Come, Smeagol. Trust master. Come!\n",
      "815 We must go now?\n",
      "816 Smeagol, you must trust master. Follow me, come on. Come. Come, Smeagol. Nice Smeagol. That's it. Come on.\n",
      "818 Don't hurt him! Smeagol don't struggle! Smeagol listen to me!\n",
      "819 Master!!\n",
      "821 No! No!\n",
      "822 Where are you leading them? Answer me!\n",
      "823 Smeagol... Why does it cry, Smeagol?\n",
      "824 Cruel men hurts us. Master trickst us.\n",
      "825 Of course he did. I told you he was tricksy. I told you he was false.\n",
      "826 Master is our friend... our friend.\n",
      "827 Master betrayed us.\n",
      "828 No, not its business. Leave us alone!\n",
      "829 Filthy little hobbitses. They stole it from us.\n",
      "830 No... No!\n",
      "831 What did they steal?\n",
      "832 Myyy PRECIOUSSS!!  Aaaarrrggghhh!!!\n",
      "835 We have to get out of here. You go. Go, now! You can do it. Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on. Disappear.\n",
      "836 I can'tt. You were right, Sam. You tried to tell me, but ... I'm sorry. The Ring's taking me Sam. If I put it on, he'll find me. He'll see.\n",
      "837 Mr. Frodo...\n",
      "839 So... this is the answer to all the riddles. Here in the wild I have you. Two halflings and a host of men at my call. The Ring of power within my grasp.\n",
      "841 A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.\n",
      "843 No!!\n",
      "844 Stop it! Leave him alone! Don't you understand? He's got to destroy it. That's where we're going. Into Mordor. To the mountain of fire.\n",
      "846 Osgiliath is under attack. They call for reinforcements.\n",
      "847 Please. It's such a burden. Will you not help him?\n",
      "848 Captain?\n",
      "849 Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to Gondor.\n",
      "853 Mae carnen, Brego, mellon n'n. (Well done, Brego, my friend)\n",
      "855 He's alive!\n",
      "856 Where is he? Where is he? Get out of the way. I'm gonna kill him!  You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew!  Bless you, laddie!\n",
      "857 Gimli, where is the king?\n",
      "859 Le ab-dollen. (You're late.)  You look terrible.\n",
      "861 Hannon le. (Thank you.)\n",
      "864 A great host, you say?\n",
      "865 All Isengard is emptied\n",
      "866 How many?\n",
      "867 Ten thousand strong at least.\n",
      "868 Ten thousand?!\n",
      "869 It is an army bred for a single purpose: to destroy the world of men. They will be here by nightfall.\n",
      "870 Let them come!\n",
      "872 I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.\n",
      "874 We will cover the causeway and the gate from above. No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg.\n",
      "875 This is no rabble of mindless Orcs. These are Uruk-hai. Their armor is thick and their shields broad.\n",

      "1085 South? But that will lead you past Isengard.\n",
      "1086 Yes. Exactly. If we go south we can slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm. It's the last thing he'll expect.\n",
      "1087 Mmmm. That doesn't make sense to me. But then, you are very small. Perhaps you're right. South it is then. Hold on, little Shirelings. I always like going south. Somehow it feels like going down hill.\n",

      "1171 I can'tt do this, Sam.\n",
      "1172 I know. It's all wrong. By rights we shouldn't even be here. But we are.  It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy?  How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?\n",
      "1173 Victory! We have victory!\n",
      "1174 But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow.  Even darkness must pass. A new day will come.  And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn't. They kept going because they were holding on to something.\n",
      "1175 What are we holding on to, Sam?\n",
      "1176 There's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it's worth fighting for.\n",

      "1180 Then it is forfeit. Release them.\n",
      "1182 Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift. The battle for Helm's Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin. All our hopes now lie with two little hobbits. Somewhere in the wilderness.\n",
      "1184 I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.\n",
      "1185 What?\n",
      "1186 I wonder if people will ever say, 'let's hear about Frodo and the Ring.' And they'll say 'yes, that's one of my favorite stories. Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, dad.' 'Yes, my boy, the most famousest of hobbits. And that's saying alot.'\n",
      "1187 Huh, you left out one of the chief characters : Samwise the Brave. I want to hear more about Sam.\n",
      "1189 Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.\n",
      "1190 Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun. I was being serious.\n",

      "71 Yes...\n",
      "72 You've been there before?\n",
      "73 Yes...\n",
      "75 You will lead us to the Black Gate.\n",

      "82 Man-flesh.\n",
      "83 Aragorn!\n",
      "84 They've picked up our trail! Let's move!\n",
      "87 Their pace has quickened.  They must have caught our scent. Hurry!\n",
      "88 Come on, Gimli!\n",
      "89 Three days' and nights' pursuit. No food. No rest. And no sign of our quarry but what bare rock can tell.\n",
      "91 Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.\n",
      "92 They may yet be alive.\n",
      "93 Less than a day ahead of us. Come!\n",
      "95 Come, Gimli! We are gaining on them!\n",
      "96 I am wasted on cross-country! We dwarves are natural sprinters! Very dangerous over short distances!\n",
      "99 Rohan. Home of the horse-lords. There is something strange at work here. Some evil gives speed to these creatures, sets its will against us.\n",
      "101 Legolas, what do your Elf eyes see?\n",
      "102 The Uruks turn northeast. They're taking the hobbits to Isengard!\n",
      "103 Saruman.\n",
      "106 The world is changing.  Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor? To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?\n",
      "108 Together, my lord Sauron, we shall rule this Middle-earth.\n",
      "110 The old world will burn in the fires of industry. The forests will fall. A new order will rise. We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc. We have only to remove those who oppose us.\n",
      "112 The horsemen took your land. They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.\n",
      "113 Murderers!\n",
      "114 Take back the lands they stole from you! Burn every village!\n",
      "115 Argh!!\n",
      "117 It will begin in Rohan. Too long have these peasants stood against you. But no more.\n",
      "119 Eothain! Eothain! You take your sister. You'll go faster with just two.\n",
      "120 Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf, he is too big for him!\n",
      "121 Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm. Do you understand me?\n",
      "122 Yes, Ma!\n",
      "123 I don't wanna leave! I don't wanna go, Mama!\n",
      "124 Freda, I will find you there.\n",

      "133 Theodred!\n",
      "136 Your son is badly wounded, my lord.\n",
      "137 That is a lie!  Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.\n",
      "138 Grima. Grima. My son...? Grima...?\n",
      "139 Orcs are roaming freely across our lands. Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at will. Orcs bearing the white hand of Saruman.\n",
      "140 Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind. Can you not see? Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent, your war-mongering.\n",
      "141 War-mongering?\n",
      "143 How long is it since Saruman bought you? What was the promised price, Grima? When all the men are dead you will take your share of the treasure?\n",
      "145 Too long have you watched my sister, too long have you haunted her steps.\n",
      "147 You see much Eomer, Son of Eomund. Too much.  You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan. Under pain of death!\n",

      "154 Get a fire going!\n",
      "156 Merry! Merry!\n",
      "157 I think... we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.\n",
      "159 What's making that noise?\n",
      "160 It's the trees.\n",
      "161 What?\n",
      "162 Do you remember the Old Forest? On the borders of Buckland? Folk used to say that there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall... and come alive.\n",
      "163 Alive?\n",
      "164 Trees that could whisper. Talk to each other. Even move.\n",
      "165 I'm starving. We ain't 'ad nothin' but maggoty bread for three stinkin' days!\n",
      "166 Yeah. Why can'tt we have some meat?  What about them? They're fresh.\n",
      "167 They are not for eating!\n",
      "168 What about their legs? They don't need those. Ooh! They look tasty!\n",
      "169 Get back, scum!\n",
      "171 Carve them up!\n",
      "172 Just a mouth full.\n",
      "173 No!\n",
      "175 Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys!!\n",
      "177 Pippin, let's go.\n",
      "179 Go on, call for help. Squeal! No one's gonna save you now!\n",
      "181 Pippin!\n",
      "183 ARGH!!!\n",
      "186 A red sun rises. Blood has been spilled this night.\n",
      "188 Riders of Rohan, what news from the Mark?\n",
      "190 What business does an Elf, a man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speak quickly!\n",
      "191 Give me your name, Horsemaster, and I shall give you mine.\n",
      "193 I would cut off your head, Dwarf, if it stood but a little higher from the ground.\n",
      "195 You would die before your stroke fell!\n",
      "197 I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This is Gimli, son of Gloin and Legolas of the Woodland realm. We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.\n",
      "198 Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.  Not even his own kin.\n",
      "200 Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands. My company are those loyal to Rohan. And for that, we are banished. The White Wizard is cunning. He walks here and there, they say, as an old man, hooded and cloaked. And everywhere his spies slip past our nets.\n",
      "201 We are not spies. We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain. They've taken two of our friends captive.\n",
      "202 But there were two hobbits. Did you see two hobbits with them?\n",
      "203 They would be small, only children to your eyes.\n",
      "204 We left none alive. We piled the carcasses and burned them.\n",
      "205 Dead?\n",
      "206 I am sorry.\n",
      "209 Look for your friends. But do not trust to hope, it has forsaken these lands.  We ride north!\n",
      "211 It's one of their wee belts.\n",
      "212 May they find peace in death\n",
      "213 AAARRGGHH!!!\n",
      "214 We failed them.\n",
      "216 A hobbit lay here, and the other.  They crawled.\n",
      "218 Their hands were bound.  Their bonds were cut.\n",
      "219 They ran over here. They were followed.\n",
      "221 The belt!\n",
      "223 Run!\n",
      "224 The tracks lead away from the battle...  into Fangorn Forest.\n",
      "226 Fangorn. What madness drove them in there?\n",
      "229 Did we lose him?  I think we lost him.\n",
      "231 I'm gonna rip out your filthy little innards! Come here!\n",
      "233 Trees! Climb a tree!\n",
      "235 He's gone.\n",
      "237 Merry!\n",
      "239 Hooooo...\n",
      "240 Argh!!\n",
      "242 Let's put a maggot-hole in your belly.\n",
      "243 Run, Merry!\n",
      "245 Little Orcs! Burarum...\n",
      "246 It's talking, Merry. The tree is talking!\n",
      "247 Tree?! I am no tree. I am an Ent.\n",
      "248 A treeherder! A shepherd of the forest.\n",
      "249 Don't talk to it, Merry. Don't encourage it.\n",
      "250 Treebeard, some call me.\n",
      "251 And whose side are you on?\n",
      "252 Side? I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc. Nobody cares for the woods anymore.\n",
      "253 We're not Orcs. We're Hobbits!\n",
      "254 Hobbits? Never heard of a hobbit before. Sounds like Orc mischief to me!  They come with fire, they come with axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning! Destroyers and usurpers, curse them!\n",
      "255 No, you don't understand. We're Hobbits... Halflings! Shirefolk!\n",
      "256 Maybe you are and maybe you aren't. The White Wizard will know.\n",
      "257 The White Wizard?\n",
      "258 Saruman.\n",
      "262 See, see, we have led you out! Hurry hobbitses hurry. Very lucky we find you.\n",
      "264 Nice hobbit.\n",
      "266 Whoa, it's a bog! He's led us into a swamp!\n",
      "267 A swamp, yes, yes. Come, master. We will take you on safe paths through the mist. Come, hobbits, come. We go quickly.\n",
      "269 I found it, I did. The way through the marshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it. They go round for miles and miles. Come quickly. Swift and quick as shadows we must be.\n",
      "271 There are dead things! Dead faces in the water!\n",
      "272 All dead. All rotten. Elves and men and orcses. A great battle long ago.  The Dead Marshes. Yes, yes that is their name. This way. Don't follow the lights.\n",
      "274 Ohh!\n",
      "275 Careful now, or hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.\n",
      "277 Frodo!\n",
      "279 Gollum...\n",
      "280 Don't follow the lights!\n",
      "281 Mr. Frodo! Are you alright?\n",
      "285 Sooo bright. Sooo beautiful.  our preciousss...\n",
      "286 What did you say?\n",
      "287 Master should be resting. Master needs to keep up his strength.\n",
      "288 Who are you?\n",
      "289 Mustn't ask us. Not its business. *Gollum, Gollum*\n",
      "290 Gandalf told me you were one of the River Folk.\n",
      "291 Cold be heart and hand and bone. Cold be travellers far from home.\n",
      "292 He said your life was a sad story.\n",
      "293 They do not see what lies ahead, when sun has failed and moon is dead.\n",
      "294 You were not so very different from a hobbit once, were you... Smeagol?\n",
      "295 What did you call me?\n",
      "296 That was your name once, wasn't it? A long time ago.\n",
      "297 My name... My name... S... S...Smeagol.\n",
      "299 Argh!!\n",
      "300 Black Riders!\n",
      "301 Hide! Hide!\n",
      "302 Argh!\n",
      "304 Argh!!\n",
      "305 C'mon Frodo! C'mon!\n",
      "307 Quick! They will see us! They will see us!\n",
      "308 I thought they were dead!\n",
      "309 Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No.\n",
      "311 Wraiths! Wraiths on wings! They are calling for it. They are calling for the preciousss.\n",
      "313 Mr. Frodo! It's alright. I'm here.\n",
      "315 Hurry, hobbits. The Black Gate is very close.\n",
      "318 Ptui! Orc blood.\n",
      "319 These are strange tracks.\n",
      "320 The air is so close in here.\n",
      "321 This forest is old. Very old. Full of memory... and anger.\n",
      "323 The trees are speaking to each other.\n",
      "324 Gimli!\n",
      "325 Huh?\n",
      "326 Lower your axe.\n",
      "327 Oh.\n",
      "328 Something is out there.\n",
      "329 What do you see?\n",
      "331 The White Wizard approaches.\n",
      "332 Do not let him speak. He will put a spell on us.\n",
      "334 We must be quick.\n",
      "336 You are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits.\n",
      "337 Where are they?\n",
      "338 They passed this way the day before yesterday. They met someone they did not expect. Does that comfort you?\n",
      "339 Who are you? Show yourself!\n",
      "341 It cannot be. You fell.\n",
      "342 Through fire and water.  From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak, I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.\n",
      "344 Until at last, I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.\n",
      "346 Darkness took me. And I strayed out of thought and time.  Stars wheeled overhead and everyday was as long as a life-age of the earth. But it was not the end. I felt life in me again.\n",
      "348 I've been sent back until my task is done.\n",
      "349 Gandalf!\n",
      "350 Gandalf? Yes... That's what they used to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was my name.\n",
      "351 Gandalf!\n",
      "352 I am Gandalf the White.  And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.\n",
      "354 One stage of your journey is over, another begins. War has come to Rohan. We must ride to Edoras with all speed.\n",
      "356 That is one of the Mearas, unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.\n",
      "358 Shadowfax.  He's the lord of all horses and he's been my friend through many dangers.\n",
      "362 My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain. I told Gandalf I would keep you safe and safe is where I'll keep you. The trees have grown wild and dangerous. Anger festers in their hearts. They will harm you if they can. There are too few of us now. Too few of us Ents left to manage them.\n",
      "365 The Black Gate of Mordor.\n",
      "367 Oh save us. My ol' Gaffer'd have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.\n",
      "368 Master says to show him the way into Mordor, so good Smeagol does. Master says so.\n",
      "369 I did.\n",
      "371 That's it then. We cannot get past that.\n",
      "373 Look! The gate, it's opening! I can see a way down.\n",
      "375 Sam, no!\n",
      "376 Argh!!\n",
      "378 Master!\n",
      "380 I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.\n",
      "381 I know, Mr Frodo. I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.\n",
      "383 Now!\n",
      "385 No! No, no master! They catch you! They catch you! Don't take it to him! He wants the preciousss. Always he's looking for it! And the preciousss is wanting to go back to him. But we mustn't let him have it.\n",
      "387 No!  There's another way. More secret. A dark way.\n",
      "388 Why haven't you spoken of this before?!\n",
      "389 Because Master did not ask!\n",
      "390 He's up to something.\n",
      "391 Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?\n",
      "392 Yes. There is a path, and some stairs, and then...a tunnel.\n",
      "393 He's led us this far, Sam.\n",
      "394 Mr. Frodo, no.\n",
      "395 He's been true to his word.\n",
      "396 No!\n",
      "397 Lead the way, Smeagol.\n",
      "398 Good Smeagol always helps.\n",
      "401 Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan, whose mind is overthrown. Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.\n",
      "404 Will you not go to him?  Will you do nothing?\n",
      "406 Be careful what you say. Do not look for welcome here.\n",
      "410 Oh, he ... he must have died sometime in the night. What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.\n",
      "412 I understand his passing is hard to accept, especially now that your brother has deserted you.\n",
      "413 Leave me alone, snake!\n",
      "414 Oh, but you are alone! Who knows what you have spoken to the darkness. In bitter watches of the night, when all your life seems to shrink, the walls of your bower closing in about you, like a hutch to trammel some wild thing in.\n",
      "416 So fair, so cold, like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.\n",
      "418 Your words are poison!\n",
      "420 You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.\n",
      "422 Ah.\n",
      "423 I cannot allow you before Theoden-King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order of Grima Wormtongue.\n",
      "425 Your staff.\n",
      "426 Hmm?  Oh. You would not part an old man from his walking stick?\n",
      "428 My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming. He's a herald of woe.\n",
      "429 The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, Theoden King.\n",
      "431 He's not welcome.\n",
      "432 Why should I welcome you, Gandalf Stormcrow?\n",
      "433 A just question, my liege.  Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear. Lathspell spell I name him. Ill news is an ill guest.\n",
      "434 Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind you teeth. I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm!\n",
      "435 His staff!  I told you to take the wizard's staff!\n",
      "437 Theoden, son of Thengel, too long have you sat in the shadows.\n",
      "439 I would stay still, if I were you.\n",
      "440 Hearken to me! I release you from the spell.\n",
      "441 Hahahhhahahahah!  You have no power here, Gandalf the Grey!\n",
      "443 Argh!\n",
      "444 I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.\n",
      "446 Wait.\n",
      "447 If I go. . . Theoden dies.\n",
      "449 You did not kill me, you will not kill him!\n",
      "450 Rohan is mine!\n",
      "451 Be gone!!\n",
      "453 I know your face. Eowyn Eowyn.\n",
      "455 Gandalf?\n",
      "456 Breathe the free air again, my friend.\n",
      "458 Dark have been my dreams of late.\n",
      "459 Your fingers would remember their old strength better... if they grasped your sword.\n",
      "461 Argh!  I've only ever served you, my lord!\n",
      "462 Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!\n",
      "463 Send me not from your side.\n",
      "465 No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go. Enough blood has been spilled on his account.\n",
      "467 Get out of my way!\n",
      "468 Hail, Theoden king!\n",
      "470 Where is Theodred? Where is my son?\n",
      "473 Simbelmyn'. Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.  Now it shall cover the grave of my son. Alas, that these evil days should be mine. The young perish and the old linger. That I should live to see the last days of my house.\n",
      "474 Theodred's death was not of your making.\n",
      "475 No parent should have to bury their child.\n",
      "477 Be-thou well. Go-thou, Theodred, go-thou.\n",
      "479 They had no warning. They were unarmed. Now the wildmen are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go. Rick, cot and tree.\n",
      "480 Where's mama?\n",
      "481 Shh...\n",
      "482 This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash. All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron. Ride out and meet him head on. Draw him away from your women and children.  You must fight.\n",
      "483 You have two thousand good men riding north as we speak. Eomer is loyal to you. His men will return and fight for their king.\n",
      "484 They will be three hundred leagues from here by now. Eomer cannot help us. I know what it is that you want of me. But I will not bring further death to my people. I will not risk open war.\n",
      "486 Open war is upon you. Whether you would risk it or not.\n",
      "487 When last I looked, Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.\n",
      "489 Then what is the king's decision?\n",
      "491 By order of the king, the city must empty. We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep. Do not burden yourselves with treasures. Take only what provisions you need.\n",
      "493 Helm's Deep! They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight. Who will defend them if not their king.\n",
      "494 He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people. Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.\n",
      "496 There is no way out of that ravine. Theoden is walking into a trap. He thinks he's leading them to safety. What they will get is a massacre. Theoden has a strong will but I fear for him. I fear for the survival of Rohan. He will need you before the end, Aragorn. The people of Rohan will need you. The defences HAVE to hold.\n",
      "497 They will hold.\n",
      "498 The Grey Pilgrim... that's what they used to call me. Three hundred lives of men I've walked this earth and now I have no time. With luck, my search will not be in vain. Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the East.\n",
      "499 Go.\n",
      "503 You have some skill with a blade.\n",
      "505 Women of this country learned long ago: Those without swords may still die upon them. I fear neither death nor pain.\n",
      "506 What do you fear, my lady?\n",
      "507 A cage. To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them and all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.\n",
      "508 You are a daughter of kings, a shieldmaiden of Rohan.  I do not think that would be your fate.\n",
      "512 Theoden will not stay at Edoras. It's vulnerable, he knows this. He will expect an attack on the city. They will flee to Helm's Deep, the great fortress of Rohan. It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains. They will be slow. They will have women and children with them.\n",
      "514 Send out your warg riders.\n",
      "518 Hey Stinker! Don't go getting too far ahead!\n",
      "519 Why do you do that?\n",
      "520 What?\n",
      "521 Call him names; run him down all the time.\n",
      "522 Because ... because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in 'im but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he wants. It's all he cares about.\n",
      "523 You have no idea what it did to him. What it's still doing to him.  I want to help him, Sam...\n",
      "524 Why?\n",
      "525 Because I have to believe he can come back.\n",
      "526 You can'tt save him, Mr. Frodo.\n",
      "527 What do you know about it? Nothing!\n",
      "529 I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that.\n",
      "530 I do. It's the Ring. You can't take your eyes off it. I've seen you. You're not eating. You barely sleep. It's taken a hold of you, Mr Frodo. You have to fight it!\n",
      "531 I know what I have to do Sam. The Ring was entrusted to me! It's my task! Mine! My own!\n",
      "532 Can't you hear yourself? Don't you know who you sound like?\n",
      "536 We wants it. We needs it. Must have the precioussss. They stole it from us. Sneaky little hobbitsesss. Wicked, trickssssy, falssse!\n",
      "537 No! Not Master.\n",
      "538 Yes, precious. False. They will cheat you, hurt you, lie.\n",
      "539 Master's my friend.\n",
      "540 You don't have any friends. Nobody likes YOU...\n",
      "541 Not listening. I'm not listening.\n",
      "542 You're a liar and a thief.\n",
      "543 Nope.\n",
      "544 Murderer!\n",
      "545 Go away.\n",
      "546 Go away!  HAHAHAHA!!\n",
      "547 I hate you. I hate you!\n",
      "548 Where would you be without me? *Gollum, gollum*. I saved us. It was me. We survived because of me!\n",
      "549 Not anymore.\n",
      "550 What did you say?\n",
      "551 Master looks after us now. We don't need you.\n",
      "552 What?\n",
      "553 Leave now and never come back.\n",
      "554 No!!\n",
      "555 Leave now and never come back!\n",
      "556 Arrrgh!!!\n",
      "557 LEAVE. NOW. AND. NEVER. COME. BACK!\n",
      "559 We... we told him to go away! And away he goes, preciousss.  Gone, gone, gone! Smeagol is free!\n",
      "561 Look! Look! See what Smeagol finds! Hehehe! Hahaha!\n",
      "563 They are young. They are tender. They are nice. Yes they are! Eat them! Eat them!\n",
      "565 You'll make him sick, you will, behaving like that!  There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.\n",
      "567 Argh!! What's it doing! Stupid fat hobbit! It ruins it!\n",
      "568 What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat on them.\n",
      "570 What we need is a few good taters.\n",
      "571 What's taters, preciousss? What's taters uh?\n",
      "572 PO-TAY-TOES! Boil them. Mash them. Stick them in a stew. Lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish....\n",
      "573 Pbbbttt!!\n",
      "574 Even you couldn't say no to that.\n",
      "575 Oh yes we could! Spoil nice fish...  Give it to usss rrraw... and wrrriggling!  You keep nasty chips.\n",
      "576 You're hopeless.\n",
      "578 Mr. Frodo?\n",
      "580 Who are they?\n",
      "581 Wicked men. Servants of Sauron. They are called to Mordor. The Dark One is gathering all armies to him. It won't be long now. He will soon be ready.\n",
      "582 Ready to do what?\n",
      "583 To make his war. The last war that will cover all the world in shadow.\n",
      "584 We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.\n",
      "585 Mr Frodo! Look! It's an Oliphaunt!\n",
      "587 No one at home will believe this...\n",
      "589 Smeagol?\n",
      "591 We've lingered here too long. Come on, Sam!\n",
      "593 Ah!\n",
      "595 Bind their hands.\n",
      "598 It's true you don't see many Dwarf women. And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance, haha that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.\n",
      "600 It's the beards....\n",
      "601 And this, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women. And that dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground!\n",
      "602 Hahahaha!!\n",
      "603 Hehehe! Which is of course ridiculous. Whoa!!\n",
      "605 It's alright, it's alright. Nobody panic. That was deliberate. It was deliberate.\n",
      "607 The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane' It is mine to give to whom I will... Like my heart. Go to sleep...\n",
      "609 I am asleep. This is a dream.\n",
      "610 Then it is a good dream. Sleep.\n",
      "612 You told me once that this day would come.\n",
      "613 This is not the end... it is the beginning. You must go with Frodo. That is your path.\n",
      "614 My path is hidden from me.\n",
      "615 It is already laid before your feet. You cannot falter now.\n",
      "616 Arwen ...\n",
      "618 If you trust nothing else... trust this. Trust us.\n",
      "623 Our time here is ending. Arwen ...s time is ending. Let her go. Let her take the ship into the west. Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands. There it will be evergreen.\n",
      "624 But never more than a memory.\n",
      "625 I will not leave my daughter here to die.\n",
      "626 She stays because she still has hope.\n",
      "627 She stays for YOU! She belongs with her people!\n",
      "629 You have a chance for another life. Away from war... grief... despair.\n",
      "630 Why are you saying this?\n",
      "631 I am mortal; you are Elfkind. It was a dream, Arwen, nothing more.\n",
      "633 This belongs to you.\n",
      "634 It was a gift. Keep it.\n",
      "636 She is sailing to the Undying Lands, with all that is left of her kin.\n",
      "638 What is it? Hama?\n",
      "640 I'm not sure.\n",
      "642 Wargs!\n",
      "644 Argh!  A scout!\n",
      "645 What is it? What do you see?\n",
      "646 Wargs! We are under attack!\n",
      "648 Get them out of here!\n",
      "649 All riders to the head of the column!\n",
      "650 Come on, get me up here, I'm a rider! Argh!\n",
      "652 You must lead the people to Helm's Deep. And make haste!\n",
      "653 I can fight!\n",
      "654 No! You must do this... for me.\n",
      "656 Follow me! Yah!\n",
      "657 Forward. I mean, charge forward! March forward!  That's it! Go on!\n",
      "658 Make for the lower ground! Stick together!\n",
      "661 Argh!!\n",
      "662 CHARGE!!\n",
      "664 Bring your pretty face to my axe!\n",
      "666 Argh! That one counts as mine!\n",
      "668 Argh! Stinking creature. Argh!\n",
      "670 Ooh..!\n",
      "672 Oooh!!\n",
      "674 Aragorn!\n",
      "675 Aragorn?\n",
      "677 Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.\n",
      "678 He's  dead.  Took a little tumble off the cliff.\n",
      "679 You lie!\n",
      "681 Get the wounded on horses. The wolves of Isengard will return. Leave the dead.\n",
      "683 Come.\n",
      "687 Helm's Deep! At last! There it is!\n",
      "688 We're safe, my lady! Thank you!\n",
      "690 Mama!\n",
      "691 Eothain! Freda!\n",
      "693 Make way for Theoden!\n",
      "694 Sire!\n",
      "695 Make way for the king!\n",
      "697 So few. So few of you have returned.\n",
      "698 Our people are safe. We have paid for it with many lives.\n",
      "699 My lady...\n",
      "700 Lord Aragorn, where is he?\n",
      "701 He fell...\n",
      "705 Draw all our forces behind the wall. Bar the gate, and set a watch on the surround.\n",
      "706 What of those who cannot fight, my lord? The women and children?\n",
      "707 Get them into the caves.  Saruman's arm would have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.\n",
      "709 Helm's Deep has one weakness. Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.\n",
      "711 How? How can fire undo stone? What kind of device could bring down the wall?\n",
      "713 If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.\n",
      "715 Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning, thousands to storm the keep.\n",
      "716 Tens of thousands.\n",
      "717 But, my lord, there is no such force.\n",
      "719 A new power is rising. Its victory is at hand!\n",
      "721 This night, the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan! March to Helms Deep! Leave none alive!\n",
      "723 To war!!\n",
      "725 There will be no dawn for Men.\n",
      "729 Look! There's smoke to the south!\n",
      "730 There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.\n",
      "731 Isengard?\n",
      "733 There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods. But now he has a mind of metal and wheels. He no longer cares for growing things.\n",
      "735 What is it?\n",
      "736 It's Saruman's army! The war has started.\n",
      "739 May the grace of the Valar protect you.\n",
      "741 Brego.\n",
      "743 Arwen.\n",
      "745 Arwen, it is time. The ships are leaving for Valinor. Go now... before it is too late.\n",
      "746 I have made my choice.\n",
      "747 He is not coming back. Why do you linger here when there is no hope?\n",
      "748 There is still hope.\n",
      "749 If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted. If Sauron is defeated, and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true, you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality. Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time, Aragorn will die.\n",
      "751 And there will be no comfort for you. No comfort to ease the pain of his passing. He will come to death, an image of the splendor of the kings of men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.\n",
      "753 But you, my daughter, you will linger on in darkness and in doubt. As nightfall in winter that comes without a star. Here you will dwell, bound to your grief, under the fading trees, until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.\n",
      "755 Arwen... there is nothing for you here, only death.\n",
      "757 Do I not also have your love?\n",
      "758 You have my love, father\n",
      "761 The world has changed... I feel it in the water, I feel it in the earth, I smell it in the air.\n",
      "763 In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong. It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of men.\n",
      "765 Men, who are so easily seduced by its power. The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hands, take the Ring for his own and the world will fall. It is close now, so close to achieving its goal.\n",
      "767 For Sauron will have dominion of all life on this Earth, even unto the ending of the world. The time of the Elves is over.\n",
      "769 Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate? Do we let them stand alone?\n",
      "772 What news?\n",
      "773 Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan. Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.  But we must look to our own borders. Faramir, Orcs are on the move. Sauron is marshalling an army. Easterlings and Southrons are passing through the Black Gate.\n",
      "774 How many?\n",
      "775 Some thousands. More come every day.\n",
      "776 Who's covering the river to the north?\n",
      "777 We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath, but if the city is attacked, we won't hold it.\n",
      "778 Saruman attacks from Isengard. Sauron from Mordor. The fight will come to men on both fronts. Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us soon. And he will strike hard. He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.\n",
      "780 My men tell me that you are Orc spies.\n",
      "781 Spies?! Now wait just a minute!\n",
      "782 Well if you're not spies, then who are you?\n",
      "784 Speak.\n",
      "785 We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.\n",
      "786 Your bodyguard?\n",
      "787 His gardener.\n",
      "788 And where is your skulking friend? That gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured look.\n",
      "789 There was no other.\n",
      "791 We set out from Rivendell with seven companions. One we lost in Moria. Two were my kin. A Dwarf there was also, and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.\n",
      "792 You're a friend of Boromir?\n",
      "793 Yes... for my part.\n",
      "794 It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.\n",
      "795 Dead? How? When?\n",
      "796 As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.  He was my brother.\n",
      "799 Captain Faramir.  We found the third one.\n",
      "801 You must come with me. Now.\n",
      "803 Down there.\n",
      "805 To enter the forbidden pool bears the penalty of death.  They wait for my command.\n",
      "807 Shall I shoot?\n",
      "809 The rock and pool is nice and cool, so juicy sweet! I only wish  to catch a fish , so juicy sweet!\n",
      "811 Wait!  This creature is bound to me. And I to him. He is our guide. Please, let me go down to him.\n",
      "813 Smeagol.  Master is here. Come, Smeagol. Trust master. Come!\n",
      "815 We must go now?\n",
      "816 Smeagol, you must trust master. Follow me, come on. Come. Come, Smeagol. Nice Smeagol. That's it. Come on.\n",
      "818 Don't hurt him! Smeagol don't struggle! Smeagol listen to me!\n",
      "819 Master!!\n",
      "821 No! No!\n",
      "822 Where are you leading them? Answer me!\n",
      "823 Smeagol... Why does it cry, Smeagol?\n",
      "824 Cruel men hurts us. Master trickst us.\n",
      "825 Of course he did. I told you he was tricksy. I told you he was false.\n",
      "826 Master is our friend... our friend.\n",
      "827 Master betrayed us.\n",
      "828 No, not its business. Leave us alone!\n",
      "829 Filthy little hobbitses. They stole it from us.\n",
      "830 No... No!\n",
      "831 What did they steal?\n",
      "832 Myyy PRECIOUSSS!!  Aaaarrrggghhh!!!\n",
      "835 We have to get out of here. You go. Go, now! You can do it. Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on. Disappear.\n",
      "836 I can'tt. You were right, Sam. You tried to tell me, but ... I'm sorry. The Ring's taking me Sam. If I put it on, he'll find me. He'll see.\n",
      "837 Mr. Frodo...\n",
      "839 So... this is the answer to all the riddles. Here in the wild I have you. Two halflings and a host of men at my call. The Ring of power within my grasp.\n",
      "841 A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.\n",
      "843 No!!\n",
      "844 Stop it! Leave him alone! Don't you understand? He's got to destroy it. That's where we're going. Into Mordor. To the mountain of fire.\n",
      "846 Osgiliath is under attack. They call for reinforcements.\n",
      "847 Please. It's such a burden. Will you not help him?\n",
      "848 Captain?\n",
      "849 Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to Gondor.\n",
      "853 Well done, Brego, my friend\n",
      "855 He's alive!\n",
      "856 Where is he? Where is he? Get out of the way. I'm gonna kill him!  You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew!  Bless you, laddie!\n",
      "857 Gimli, where is the king?\n",
      "859 You're late.\n",
      "861 Thank you.\n",
      "864 A great host, you say?\n",
      "865 All Isengard is emptied\n",
      "866 How many?\n",
      "867 Ten thousand strong at least.\n",
      "868 Ten thousand?!\n",
      "869 It is an army bred for a single purpose: to destroy the world of men. They will be here by nightfall.\n",
      "870 Let them come!\n",
      "872 I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.\n",
      "874 We will cover the causeway and the gate from above. No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg.\n",
      "875 This is no rabble of mindless Orcs. These are Uruk-hai. Their armor is thick and their shields broad.\n",
      "876 I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf. I know how to defend my own keep.\n",
      "878 They will break upon this fortress like water on rock. Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn, we've seen it before. Crops can be resown; homes rebuilt. Within these walls, we will outlast them.\n",
      "879 They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages. They come to destroy its people. Down to the last child.\n",
      "880 What would you have me do? Look at my men. Their courage hangs by a thread. If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.\n",
      "881 Send out riders, my lord. You must call for aid.\n",
      "882 And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We are not so lucky in our friends as you. The old alliances are dead.\n",
      "883 Gondor will answer.\n",
      "884 Gondor? Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell? Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us? Where was Gon' ' No, my lord Aragorn, we are alone.  Get the women and children into the caves.\n",
      "885 We need more time to lay provisions for a siege, lord.\n",
      "886 There is no time. War is upon us!\n",
      "887 Secure the gate!\n",
      "891 We Ents have not troubled about the wars of men and wizards for a very long time. But now something is about to happen that has not happened for an age... Ent Moot.\n",
      "892 What's that?\n",
      "893 'Tis a gathering.\n",
      "894 A gathering of what?\n",
      "896 Beech, oak, chestnut, ash... Good, good, good. Many have come. Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.\n",
      "900 Move back! Move to the caves!\n",
      "901 Keep moving!\n",
      "902 Quickly now!\n",
      "904 Farmer, farriers, stable boys. These are no soldiers.\n",
      "905 Most have seen too many winters.\n",
      "906 And they should be... Three hundred against ten thousand!\n",
      "907 They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras.\n",
      "908 Aragorn, we are warriors. They cannot win this fight. They are all going to die!\n",
      "909 Then I shall die as one them!\n",
      "910 Let him go, lad. Let him be.\n",
      "913 Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory. My lord?\n",
      "914 Who am I, Gamling?\n",
      "915 You are our king, sire.\n",
      "916 And do you trust your king?\n",
      "917 Your men, my lord, will follow you to whatever end.\n",
      "919 To whatever end. Where is the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? They have passed like rain on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow. The days have gone down in the west. Behind the hills, into shadow. How did it come to this?\n",
      "922 Give me your sword. What is your name?\n",
      "923 Haleth, son of Hama, my lord. The men are saying that we will not live out the night. They say that it is hopeless..\n",
      "925 This is a good sword, Haleth, son of Hama.\n",
      "927 There is always hope.\n",
      "930 We have trusted you this far. You have not led us astray. Forgive me. I was wrong to despair.\n",
      "931 There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.\n",
      "933 If we had more time I'd get this adjusted.  It's a little tight across the chest.\n",
      "935 That is no Orc horn.\n",
      "937 Send for the king. Open the gate!\n",
      "938 Open the gate!\n",
      "940 How is this possible?\n",
      "941 I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell. An alliance once existed between Elves and men. Long ago we fought and died together.  We come to honor that allegiance.\n",
      "942 Welcome, Haldir\n",
      "943 You are most welcome!\n",
      "945 We are proud to fight alongside men, once more.\n",
      "947 You could have picked a better spot.\n",
      "949 Well lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.\n",
      "951 Your friends are with you, Aragorn.\n",
      "952 Let's hope they last the night.\n",
      "955 Show them no mercy! For you shall receive none!\n",
      "957 What's happening out there?\n",
      "958 Shall I describe it to you?  Or would you like me to find you a box?\n",
      "959 Hehehehe!!\n",
      "961 Hold!\n",
      "963 So it begins.\n",
      "964 Prepare to fire!\n",
      "966 Their armor is weak at the neck and beneath the arms.\n",
      "967 Release the arrows!\n",
      "969 Did they hit anything?\n",
      "970 Give them a volley.\n",
      "971 Fire!\n",
      "973 Fire!\n",
      "976 Fire!\n",
      "977 Send them to me! C'mon!\n",
      "979 Ladders!\n",
      "981 Swords! Swords!\n",

      "1086 Yes. Exactly. If we go south we can slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm. It's the last thing he'll expect.\n",
      "1087 Mmmm. That doesn't make sense to me. But then, you are very small. Perhaps you're right. South it is then. Hold on, little Shirelings. I always like going south. Somehow it feels like going down hill.\n",

      "1171 I can'tt do this, Sam.\n",
      "1172 I know. It's all wrong. By rights we shouldn't even be here. But we are.  It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy?  How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?\n",
      "1173 Victory! We have victory!\n",
      "1174 But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow.  Even darkness must pass. A new day will come.  And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn't. They kept going because they were holding on to something.\n",
      "1175 What are we holding on to, Sam?\n",
      "1176 There's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it's worth fighting for.\n",

      "1180 Then it is forfeit. Release them.\n",
      "1182 Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift. The battle for Helm's Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin. All our hopes now lie with two little hobbits. Somewhere in the wilderness.\n",
      "1184 I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.\n",
      "1185 What?\n",
      "1186 I wonder if people will ever say, 'let's hear about Frodo and the Ring.' And they'll say 'yes, that's one of my favorite stories. Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, dad.' 'Yes, my boy, the most famousest of hobbits. And that's saying alot.'\n",
      "1187 Huh, you left out one of the chief characters : Samwise the Brave. I want to hear more about Sam.\n",
      "1189 Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.\n",
      "1190 Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun. I was being serious.\n",

      "1200 The fat hobbit, he knows. Eyes always watching.\n",
      "1201 Then we stabs them out. Put out his eyeses. And make HIM crawl.\n",
      "1202 Yes! Yes! Yes!\n",
      "1203 Kill them both.\n",
